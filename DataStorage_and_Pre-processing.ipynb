      "The best cafe of Delhi NCR. Period.   AMBIENCE- The place is located by the lanes of Hauz Khas Village, amongst many other cafes as well. The place is pretty much lit up with a quirky environment. Also, the place is very big! This is the place to be in the early evenings.  Back to the Business- FOOD!   Classic Cheese Poutine- These are the basic cheesy and baked fries, seasoned with some Italian herbs. These were fantastic! Fries were crispy and cheesy.   Butter Garlic Chilli Momos- These are the dry, pan-fried momos with enormous flavours of Butter and Garlic. These were hands down THE BEST momos I've ever had!  🔥♥️🔥 Recommended! 🔥  Mixed Sauce Pasta- The pasta was not very high on flavours, was inclined more towards the Arrabiata sauce. Go for it if you're a fan of Mix Sauce Pasta!  💯  SERVICE- The place has servers who're always happy to help you but then the crowd is in large quantity as well. Still, you'll be satisfied and engaged with a great view of the side by lake. 💯\n",

The lake view was tha best part of the restaurant. Everything here was absolutely impeccable. The service by Mr Pankaj was very good and he was so polite. According to me this was a perfect place for a date without hurting your pockets.\n",

They have a very vast menu, mainly in Italian and Continental dishes. I have ordered Spicy Chicken Tikka Pizza, Chicken Lasagne and made my own Burger. All these are amazing in taste. The ambiance is pleasing and staff is also very helpful in choosing the right dishes from the menu. Do explore this place!\n",

I felt save in this club where I met a lot of other people (or maybe it was by luck). I have given 2 stars only because the bartender didn't gave us happy hour offer and we ended up paying double the amount, quite a bummer. We ordered 4 heineken while it was still happy hour and 2 others later than that.\n",
