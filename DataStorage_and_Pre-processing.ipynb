      "I visited om Sweets today to get cake and few other things for my mom's birthday. I was accompanied by my dad.  we collected the cake and samosas from the counter and was about to start our vehicle when a staff came running towards us and asked us to show the bill of the cake. We showed him the bill of the truffle cake but he still took the cake from our hand and asked us to come inside. We were a little embarrassed with no fault of ours. We payed the bill, we collected our cake. I told my dad to wait outside. I went inside with him, and was told ab jao jao. They didn't even apologise until my dad came inside and asked him \"is this the way they treat their customers\". They should ask their guards to check the bill before hand only. We were left embarrassed in front of the people outside and were made to look like thieves who took the cake without paying. Management is the key to success. You won't be spared in the name of big brand.\n",
