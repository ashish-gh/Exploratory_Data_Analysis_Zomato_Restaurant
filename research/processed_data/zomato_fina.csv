But there were only a few tables occupied at that time (around 11:45 am). It wasn\'t too busy at all. He didn\'t even respond to us in a friendly manner. He was RUDE. He was avoiding us as if we have a contagious disease, just like what other racists do. He probably doesn\'t like Spanish-looking people or dark-skinned customers like asians. He is asian, too, but fair-skinned. In fairness, there was a female staff named ""Quhyn"" who took us a couple of photos later. I made my written complaint to the management on that day about the rudeness of ""Linus"". So, if you are dark-skinned, and decide to dine in that mediocre restaurant, and if you want to have a group photo, try to ask ""Linus"" to do it.

Sorry one star.', 'Great breakfast sitting in the morning winter sun. Very good service. Coffee great.Wife happy with presentation of her long black (see photo) Breakfast arrived timely and was a very good price. Wishing we lived nearby so that we could visit often.', ""Went for breakfast on our last day in Caloundra, and was not disappointed! I had a fantastic pancake type with naan bread, eggs and bacon. My wife had muesli which was soaked in apple juice rather than milk. Both meals were amazing. Most of the meals had a combination of eggs and bacon. The place was packed when we got there around 8 AM. They had a small number of tables inside, and a larger number outside. The place was very lively and busy. The service was good too, although most of the wait staff looked quite young they were very professional. It was a little hard to know who the staff were as there was no common uniform. We tried to get a coffee to take away when we paid, but the power had gone out so we had to pay with cash and their coffee machine wasn't working."", 'Great service, great food, great price.

It broke ground about six years ago\xa0and has been a real force in revitalizing the community.And while you might be scratching your head thinking - ""Greek? In Weirton?"" It isn\'t all that surprising to me. There\'s the Greek festival in Weirton, hosted at the Greek Orthodox church. I know of a few Greek families, and there\'s a delicious Greek restaurant right across the river in Ohio. So, there\'s a framework in which to operate here.This restaurant is located on Pennsylvania Avenue in a building that I hadn\'t been to before. There\'s a bit of parking nearby, so no worries there. The restaurant itself is broken into a few different dining spaces; it looks as though they may have expanded into spaces in the adjoining areas. The interior is simple, but cozy at the same time.So, we picked a seat, and a friendly waitress approached us with menus. Grape leaves, spanakopita, tiropita (Greek cheese pie) and a Grecian roll (cucumber, tomato, feta, tzatziki and balsamic rolled into pita bread) all file under the appetizer section. Greek salads and avgolemono soup (chicken, lemon and rice) are available for lighter fare. Sandwiches include a gyro, pork souvlaki, burgers, grilled chicken, panini, fish, chili dog, and a few Pittsburgh-esque sandwiches. Also, they have a few platters if you\'re going for the low-carb option.Well, my guess is they need a little bit of everything to appease everyone, so you can get some authentic dishes here and then burgers for the meat-and-potatoes guy. But, if you\'re wanting a true taste of Greek food in Weirton, get the gyro, which is a blend of lamb and beef, tomatoes, onions, and tzatziki on pita bread. I also upgraded my fries to the ""Greek fries,"" which are fresh-cut fries with fresh feta and oregano.Wow, this is GOOD. Tender meat cooked on a spit, topped with these spears of tomato, and all drenched in tzatziki sauce - a really good one at that. Everything was fresh, perfectly proportioned and tasty. The salty meat, the slight sweetness of the onion, the creamy sauce, the sturdy pita to pull it all together. And the fries - just look at that mountain of fresh feta. Perfectly crisp with all the light cheese. Delish.', 'What a great find for us in Weirton. The grape leaves appetizer was very fresh and tasty. \xa0The friendly staff was very familiar with the menu . The lamb and chicken gyros were delicious and there was no skimping on any ingredients. The greek fries with the feta smothered over them were awesome. \xa0 Will definitely visit again prior to the opening of their brand new location in october that is under construction.']"

Sandwiches include a gyro, pork souvlaki, burgers, grilled chicken, panini, fish, chili dog, and a few Pittsburgh-esque sandwiches.

Tender meat cooked on a spit, topped with these spears of tomato, and all drenched in tzatziki sauce - a really good one at that. Everything was fresh, perfectly proportioned and tasty. The salty meat, the slight sweetness of the onion, the creamy sauce, the sturdy pita to pull it all together. And the fries - just look at that mountain of fresh feta. Perfectly crisp with all the light cheese. Delish.', 'What a great find for us in Weirton.

All the other food from broccoli chicken spaghetti in garlic sauce to the stuffed pepper sandwich was delicious.  The restaurant is in a new building and has a very nice decor. Well worth stopping."", 'Food is awesome!! Have had nothing that was below par. Owner visits each table and greets all of the guests, makes you feel like he really cares about his patrons and his business. A real class act.', 'First off , the new location is great. The size of the new location adds a spacious touch that is less cramped and offers more privacy for the customers. The dimming lights offer a relaxed environment and the crowd is always delightful. The food: The food is always made to order fresh, the prices are reasonable and the quality is key. Lastly is the the customer service / server experience: I have visited this place at least 8-10 times and have experienced almost every server there , but there is one individual that stands out from the rest. She carried herself very well and offered and professional, polite and pleasant experience to this whole dining experience. I believe her name is Laurianne. She is very knowledgeable and can carry on a great conversation. She has great qualities that is sure to lead her to many opportunities.', 'Theo Yianni\'s is a new-ish Greek restaurant in Weirton that has been receiving rave reviews since its opening. It broke ground about six years ago\xa0and has been a real force in revitalizing the community.And while you might be scratching your head thinking - ""Greek? In Weirton?"" It isn\'t all that surprising to me. There\'s the Greek festival in Weirton, hosted at the Greek Orthodox church. I know of a few Greek families, and there\'s a delicious Greek restaurant right across the river in Ohio. So, there\'s a framework in which to operate here.This restaurant is located on Pennsylvania Avenue in a building that I hadn\'t been to before. There\'s a bit of parking nearby, so no worries there. The restaurant itself is broken into a few different dining spaces; it looks as though they may have expanded into spaces in the adjoining areas. The interior is simple, but cozy at the same time.So, we picked a seat, and a friendly waitress approached us with menus. Grape leaves, spanakopita, tiropita (Greek cheese pie) and a Grecian roll (cucumber, tomato, feta, tzatziki and balsamic rolled into pita bread) all file under the appetizer section. Greek salads and avgolemono soup (chicken, lemon and rice) are available for lighter fare. Sandwiches include a gyro, pork souvlaki, burgers, grilled chicken, panini, fish, chili dog, and a few Pittsburgh-esque sandwiches. Also, they have a few platters if you\'re going for the low-carb option.Well, my guess is they need a little bit of everything to appease everyone, so you can get some authentic dishes here and then burgers for the meat-and-potatoes guy. But, if you\'re wanting a true taste of Greek food in Weirton, get the gyro, which is a blend of lamb and beef, tomatoes, onions, and tzatziki on pita bread. I also upgraded my fries to the ""Greek fries,"" which are fresh-cut fries with fresh feta and oregano.Wow, this is GOOD. Tender meat cooked on a spit, topped with these spears of tomato, and all drenched in tzatziki sauce - a really good one at that. Everything was fresh, perfectly proportioned and tasty. The salty meat, the slight sweetness of the onion, the creamy sauce, the sturdy pita to pull it all together. And the fries - just look at that mountain of fresh feta. Perfectly crisp with all the light cheese. Delish.', 'What a great find for us in Weirton. The grape leaves appetizer was very fresh and tasty. \xa0The friendly staff was very familiar with the menu . The lamb and chicken gyros were delicious and there was no skimping on any ingredients. The greek fries with the feta smothered over them were awesome. \xa0 Will definitely visit again prior to the opening of their brand new location in october that is under construction.']"

The Food is unpalatable and stale and is on par with the food sold by street/road side vendors. My friend and I got food poisoning after eating the unhygienic food at Groghead. The drinks are a joke and are watered down with cheap alcohol and mixed with 80% watered down stale juices or bland gas-less sugary soda. \xa0 The service is the worst I have witnessed in my life! Neither are the staff members efficient, nor do they have the basic manners of dealing with a customer. Plus I am sure most of the positive ratings of groghead is Fake and reviewed positively by the owner and his family/friends.\xa0 Stay Away from this Disastrous Place and save your hard earned money to be spent on something worth it."", 'Visited with friends over cocktails, beer and snacks on a ladies night. The ambience was pretty decent with dim lighting. They had a balcony area for smokers but with limited seating.\xa0 For drinks we ordered Beer(served chilled) and Mojito was well balanced. For food we had ordered:\xa0 1)Poutine with bacon- 4/5, I absolutely loved it! Fries topped with melted cheese yumm!! Ordered twice. 2)Fish and chips with tartare sauce-3/5, taste was average, portion size decent. The vibe was good with great music. Service was on the slower side once the place got crowded. Staff was friendly and courteous.']"

Quantity wise it definitely wowed me, but taste, quality, freshness was lacking in my meal here.  Chilly chicken definitely was the biggest bummer with the chicken chunks (mostly breast pieces) being extremely chewy and rubbery. The preparation too was absolutely disappointing with chicken being separate, chilly separate and onion separate yet just lightly tossed in the wok for the dish’s sake. The golden fried prawns though were decent and the prawn size was definitely satisfying to look at. The batter though wasnt crisp enough and the prawn was overcooked. The tom kha soup definitely saved my meal here. Refreshing and very flavorful! Definitely this place will always be special to me but foodwise, they really need to up their quality delivery game to beat the latest in the market.

Firstly, we were served with buttery cookies. After that we started hogging with kala khata and chocolate shake with chicken salad , fettuccine pasta and Khow suey. Their Walnut brownie was what I loved the most in deserts.  Food tasted well but can be improved. Service was also quite slow.', 'Nice cozy place.. We had fetush salad, pesto pasta and their signature khow suey... Everything was upto the mark.. Yummy and not very hard on pocket .', 'Amidst the most underrated area of Delhi i.e Shahpur Jat, there is this cute little quirky place which has this cute ambience and a very small place but enough to get you utterly delighted. The decor, the furniture and the vibe everything is soothing but the food was a major disappointment.   What we ordered :-  1) Paan Pasand (TKC\'s Favourite)  I am a Paan freak. This is something which I have to have every weekend after dinner to give a great end to the fancy dinner and to have it as a shake was something very different. A phenomenal idea I must say and a good shot at it. But what I thought was that only giving a neon green color and only the flavor of paan was not enough. Had you put some Gulkaand touch, it would have been another level to be honest, But , for the sake of the taste of the paan it was a good attempt.  2) Spicy Banta  It was a superbly refreshing drink. Mixed chat masala within Cola was LIT. The only thing which has good in the entire order was this only. Something which can definitely ordered in case visited. It was superbly chilled and tasted superb. This is something which can definitely be made by self at home.  3) Spaghetti Aglio Olio  The basic definition of Aglio Olio is ""It\'is made by lightly sauteeing minced or pressed garlic in olive oil"". Firstly the garlic is minced but what you did put in it was the entire loaf, Secondly, the taste of olive oil is very basic and it\'s not heavy but the oil in which you tossed the pasta was, is only known by you, Thirdly, the kind of garlic so called bread that you gave seems to be one rotten dry bed which tasted real bad. Disappointment!!! Major Disappointment!! Don\'t play around with the actual recipes.   4) BBQ Chicken Burger  I was craving for a gourmet burger since a long time and hence I thought of ordering one. When it make it looked so lustrous and hot but then as the quote says appearances are deceiving and this quote is perfect here. I touched the Burger and it wasn\'t even near to warm. It was the bun base on the bottom then a layer which constituted of lettuce, cucumber, onions and tomatoes., then was the layer of the worst chicken patty being highly dry and cold with no flavor and only a thick bad patty then for the sake of the BBQ name was the barbeque sauce then a layer of smelly cheese topped with the bun. The burger disgusted me. It was so smelly and was very bad. I mean this just below the bare minimum standards.', 'This compact cafe in Shapur jat is simply amazing ! With a few issues here and there , the staff is very polite and helpful . The decor of the place is different and vibrant ! The vibe of this place just gives you this right kinda feel . The drinks are amazing and the food is really tasty !  My order was 4 different dishes  A pizza , a masala egg pao , a chicken dish and a burger ! And all of them were tasty .  The only thing this place can thrive is to look again at their menu once and change few tiny things like a margarita pizza should not have tomatoes .. or maybe to add more soft drinks  But overall I had a great experience and no complains !', 'A small place in Shahpur Jat market but worth a try.  Food was really nice in a great ambiance. Ordered pizza, which was very well baked and fresh']"

Price - is Decent may be 3/5 Taste - 3/5 Location - 3/5 It was a Buffet so No Quantity Check :p Quality -4/5  Overall once for a change nice experience.

Lot of varieties in food and interior are main attraction. The only best part about this restaurant is that they have 8-9 flavours of ice creams Like paan which is the best flavour . In non-veg starter only liked malai tikka little but rest other are not upto the mark.', ""Went to the Jungle Jamboree restaurant on my birthday. The concept is same as Barbecue Nation but what really is unique is that it has a theme. You enter the jungle and find animals greeting you and you also get a bear hug.  So, there is grill on the table and you get all the proteins that you can imagine. A live grill keeps you interested and the tandoori chicken or fish tikka never gets cold. This is non veg heaven! So, once you are done with the army of starters, you can attack on the buffet... It's reasonable for the amount of food you are gulping down. The dessert section is the best. If you want to treat your friends, this restaurant is an excellent choice. Make a reservation before going here! This place gets super crowded."", 'Nice Ambience, I definitely give 5 star rating for ambience. Food was average, I give 3.5 star rating for it. Service was ok - ok, I give 3 star rating for it.']"

The cheesecake is something very different from what I've ever had before and despite all my misgivings for wasabi, was quite a hit with my tastebuds. The Seafood Soup is something I'd not have opted for on my own but was a very pleasant surprise and resembled the likes of Thai Curry, but better.  The remaining food was nice as well, with the exception of the beetroot salad which I wasn't a big fan of.  The service was nice for the most part of it.

Megu was one of the first Michelin Starred Restaurant to open it's door in India ( New York Megu has a Michelin star). Once you enter the beautiful property , is when the experience starts . The courteous hotel staff greeted us and we're willing to walk us down to the Restaurant. Megu is located in the right hand corner of the lobby area , just next to the library bar , giving it a nice secluded feel. It was Saturday night and we had our reservation , which helped us secure our table as after sometime the whole restaurant was packed. The wait staff took us to our table and greeted us wonderfully. The restaurant is divided into multiple sections - a main dining room, Sushi table next to the chef and another dining room. We luckily were given our seat in the Main Dining room , which is the place to be. The ambience is just amazing , dark in the colour tone but with more than enough light . The centre piece of attraction is the giant Buddha Statue Sculpted out of Glass and on top of it a giant Japanese Bell with red on the inside , just makes for a perfect look. We were attended by definitely the best Server or Manager in the place and his name was Pavan. He was just very warm and welcoming . He helped us in ordering and answering all questions we had. Before the menu was given to us we were given Wet Towels to clean our hands . That in itself is a great sign of service and it's very rarely seen in restaurants. We had a glass of Red Wine along with our food which was very nice and was the Fratelli Sette. We ordered 3 starters , 2 Mains and a rice on his recommendation and honestly it was way more than what we could have , so at the end of the Meal we had to pack quite a bit of food. The food served here is Japanese but mostly Modern Japanese. And most of the things we ordered , actually just by our food choice and preference , were the signature dishes of the restaurant. For starters we ordered - Yellowtail Carpaccio , Dragon Sushi Roll and Chicken Yakitori Skewers. The Yellowtail Carpaccio and Dragon Rolls were Signature dishes. The first dish to arrive was the Yellowtail Carpaccio . Carpaccio inherently is an Italian Dish of very Thinly Slices Meat with a sauce or an oil . Japanese cuisine also incorporated this style of food but use japanese sauces and fish instead of meat . We ordered the Yellowtail Carpaccio which came with 7 pieces of Yellowtail , so thinly sliced that it was close to transparent. The Fish was topped with an Onion Jam , Daikon Oroshi Dressing , Crispy Garlic Chips and Mushrooms. Once the dish was placed , Pavan told us that all their Fish comes from the world famous Tsukiji Market of Japan . The dish was excellent , very beautiful and tasty . The fish was light and the Dressing really highlighted the fish very beautifully. The Garlic Chip just gave a great contrast to the light flavour and the mushrooms just added a great delicate mouth feel to the dish. Amazing dish and very well executed. Next dish to come to our table was the Dragon Sushi Roll , Another Signature Dish. They have traditional Nigiris , Sushi and Sushi Rolls . Sushi Rolls generally are 5-6 Pieces , but the Dragon roll is the only sushi roll which comes with 8 pieces . The Sushi comes along with Ginger and Wasabi , but they even brought out a fresh root of Wasabi which Pavan Grated in front of us to serve us Fresh Wasabi. The Fresh Wasabi was amazing , I am a fan of Wasabi but the fresh Wasabi was next level for sure. The Sushi was beautiful . The Dragon Roll consists of Avocado and Tempura Flakes on top , drizzled with Dragon sauce. The Seafood used in the Sushi is - Shrimp , Crab and Eel. The Sushi was stuffed with loads of seafood and the size of each Sushi was great . Flavour no doubt was the best I have had and really the combination of seafood with avocado and Tempura Flakes was great . The Dragon sauce was a bit sweet and spicy at the same time. Highly recommend this Sushi for first time goers as they will love it . Next was the Chicken Yakitori. The serving was 2 Yakitori Skewers with 3 pieces of Juicy and Succulent Char Grilled Chicken with a Teriyaki Glaze on top. The Chicken was grilled to perfection. The Chicken had a bit of skin on it which was just crisp and underneath it lay the Juicy and Succulent chicken . The Teriyaki Glaze was just amazing too , have the Chicken a nice Sweet flavour which really uplifted the Dish to perfection. For Maincourse we ordered - 24 Hour Braised Pork Belly , Charred French Duck Confit (Signature Dish) and a Chicken and Egg fried rice to accompany them . Will start with the Fried Rice , which was great and very unique in itself. The Fried Rice was cooked with Soy Sauce and had a great balance of flavours . Chicken and egg were in abundance and really a very fragrant , flavourful and fullfilling dish which accompanied the other dishes very well. The Braised Pork Belly had 8 pieces of huge pork belly , placed on top of Bok Choy and topped with loads of Kakuni Sauce . The Pork Belly was super Delicious , with the fat just dissolved in mouth . The Pork Meat was also very tender . The Pork also soaked up all the Delicious Kakuni Sauce which was a bit sweet , Spicy and sour all at the same time . The Bok Choy gave a great Crunch and Fresh relief along side the Meaty Pork . A Fantastic dish with a huge portion size. Final dish was the Charred French Confit Duck with Yakiniku Sauce and Barley Risotto . Another huge portion of food , the Duck came with a huge portion of sliced duck , close to 12-15 pieces and a whole duck leg too . The Barley Risotto was on the side and a cup of the Delicious sauce . The Risotto was very nice and subtle taste. The Duck was Cooked to perfection , it was extremely Juicy and tender . The Sauce was the best I had in the whole meal and in sometime too. The Sauce was thick and a but sweet which really went well with the Duck . This was my favourite Main dish for sure and really worth trying . Overall we had an amazing time with a great meal and cost for 2 came 10k , which was absolutely worth it . You are definitely paying for the fresh and high quality food , superb service and classy Ambience , infact bill can be much lower if you don't go for signature dishes and less number of dishes as the food was way more for us . Thanks team Megu and Pavan for the great experience , will be back again soon .""]"

Whenever we think of rich royal food, the Awadhi cuisine, a spectacular symphony of taste and presentations comes first in mind. The taste and aroma of Awadhi food is unbelievable.  Most of the dishes are incredibly rich and creamy, redolent with the fragrance of spices, and are delicately spiced, with cashews and raisins adding an unexpected depth to the taste of the curries.    We also wanted to taste the cuisine of the nawabs and headed for The Oudh located in The Ashok hotel, a fine dining restaurant specializing in the elusive Awadhi cuisine. The moment we entered the restaurant we fell in love with the royal rich decor that boasts of beautiful paintings of Mughal kings and queens, classy furniture, and interiors in red and white theme accompanied by silver urns. The walls are decorated with 'minakari' art and 'jalis' (latticed screens) along with paintings and other marble work.   The restaurant sprawls over a large area across the lush green lawns near the pool, with 2 PDR’s (private dining rooms) which offer full privacy to host family gatherings and high-profile lunches.   The Oudh, formerly known as Darbar opened in 1995, offers an incomparable Nawaabi experience through an array of exotic dishes created by the bawarchis (chefs) and rakabdars (gourmet cooks). The menu has been crafted keeping in mind the visiting heads of states and dignitaries that the government hosts and food lovers from all over the world and is printed in eight different languages.   Authentic kebas worth trying are Lehsoon Malai Tikka, Zeenat-e-Aab, Jhinga Mehrunnisa, Murgh Surkh Angaar, Nakhas ki Boti, etc. And for mains Nihari Gosht, Murgh Fatimi, and Oudhi Quorma which are paired with breads like Gilafi Kulchas, Sheermal and Warqi Parathas (an Awadhi flaky bread) and various rice preparations like Biryani and Pulao are worth trying.   For vegetarians, Crispy Paneer Roll, Moth Ke Asharfi, Kache Papite Ke Kabab, Lazzez Subz Seekh, Tofe e Noor, Dahi ke Koftey, Gulnar Biryani,  Nishatganj Ki Jhalfarezi, Paneer Hazrat  Mahal, Khiley Phool, and Dal Oudhi, along with Oudh Breads are recommended  Coming to our experience with the food and drinks; we were welcomed with a round of the Noor-e-Chashm mock-tail, a sweet and sour lemon fizz based mock-tail which left me refreshed and waiting for delicacies to be served.   Everything in starters section tasted amazing. I specially loved the Tohfa-e-Noor with exemplary flavours. It was a dish made of cottage cheese sheets stuffed with a slightly sweet khoya fillings and rich nuts and topped with saffron. This incidentally is one of the signature dishes served at Indian PM's state banquets.   The starters left me craving for the main course, even though I wanted to have a repeat of Tohfa-e-Noor. Maybe I’ll come back again just to relish the Paneer dish.   In the mains, I was looking forward to the biryani dish, you see, how can one finish off an Awadhi main-course without some biryani. I tried the veggie biryani, Gulnar Biryani, which was opened right in front of me. Oh man, the explosion of aromas the moment the Dum was broken was exquisite. The rich, royal flavours of Awadh were truly represented in this dish and made me think – “There really exists a Vegetarian Biryani”.   Desserts are an important part of an Awadhi meal. And here too, aroma plays an important role. The bread pudding Shahi Tukra, Milk dumplings -Khush Zaiqa, Malpua Rabri, Rasmalai, Awadhi style Vermicelli - Muzaffar, Sheer-e-Oudh, Qulifi Falooda are the ones to die for here.  I normally don’t visit a food joint again, unless I have loved the food. And having relished a sumptuous lunch of Awadhi cuisine just like the way a Nawab would have, I am longing for a revisit to the Oudh and am surely going to be there again soon."", 'Very attentive and helpful service (but without being intrusive). Absolutely delicious food - really rich flavours. Always a bit quiet so more of a romantic meal than a group outing unless you want the place to yourself. But food makes it worth coming back every time.', 'I have been to The Oudh atleast ten times and i am still ready to have another meal there. Preparation is rich with dry fruits and cream.   Murgh fatimi is totally smacking along with noor-e-chashma and barfili bahar.   I have also had buffet once which was not so mughlai but good on its own.  Service is good too.

To be fair the food both from the Wazwaan section and the rest was excellent. The service from a one-man service team was excellent again. They had an interesting version of the Lemon rice. The chef had a flair and an eye for cooking meats just right.  Another plus was that the place including the washrooms was squeaky clean. It might be a good idea if they expanded the Wazwaan section of the menu from the sub 5%. With the rest of the infrastructure so above average this might well be the differentiator that will propel Wazwaan from good to great', ""So it was birthday party celebration of colleague's daughter. We sat in basement area. Place is spacious, clean and hygienic. The menu had seekh kebabs, chicken tikka, paneer tikka and veg kebabs. Waiters were serving them on seats and they had cold drinks and fruit juices too as it was kid's birthday. I absolutely loved the starters. Personally seekh kebabs should not melt in mouth. One should be able  to feel the coarse texture and savour them. They were like that only. They also had some pakodas. But seekh and chicken tikka were too good to leave. Then moving on main course they had chicken curry, mutton roghan josh with plain and butter naan and also had chicken biryani. In Veg menu they had daal makhni, shahi paneer and veg biryani. I became fan of their roghan josh and birryani. In dessert there was gajar ka halwa which i did not taste but i tried firni. It was so fresh and aromatic it reminded me of home when mom used to freshly prepare and freeze it in fridge and used to serve in mitti kulhads. It had hint of kesar in it and was slightly yellowish in colour. I absolutely loved the food and service.

To be honest, a best bet to a place that refers to Kashmiri ...Best to stick to Kashmiri food. But we experimented by ordering Yakni, Gustaba, and some signature  north indian food such as Kadai Chicken with some yummy paratha.   Getting to taste an authentic kashmiri cuisine was great, the blends and the masalas teamed up with rice, were so flavorful took me back to Kashmir...Hope to come back here whenever I miss Kashmir  Probably needs improvement on service to a large extent.', 'I love kashmiri waazwaan..and I want perfect taste of waazwaan..

So this time they made me wait over an hour for a cake which should have been baked correctly at the first place. Utterly ridiculous and worst part, they kept on lying about where it is and how much time it would take. NEVER COMING BACK here again, EVER!!

We tried toastadas tasting platter and a vegetarian large plate dish whose name is quite difficult. Both were okay..was lagging behind in flavours.

If you are craving for real Mexican meal, look no further!\xa0  Some of my all time favorites include:  Starters La Bodega's Margarita - The frozen one is best in town! Nachos platter served with Sour Cream & Guacamole\xa0  Taquitos Dorados De Barbacoa with lamb Al Pastor with pork  Quesadillas Gringa Des Res with grilled steak (must order)  Botanas Ceviche Acapulco with seabass  Enchiladas\xa0 Arrachera Con Salsa De Cilantro with steak (another must order)\xa0  DessertChurros Con Chocolate  All these finely flavored platters exude authenticity. Usually i am stuffed with starters and snacks and have not gone forward with larger platters. I am sure they deliver the same exquisite taste and quality as the ones i have savored.  The soft decor is pleasing and the fact that Smriti Goel (the owner) takes care of every guest on the floor is commendable. It has been a great dining experience each time. Summer is here and i am missing frozen margaritas...It is time to schedule a visit to La Bodega!"", 'Great ambience! Their Quesadillas are mouth watering.. and also churros con chocolate.

The texture is perfect and thick just how it should be, not watery at all, like most of the places. I would definitely recommend this as a Must try for everyone.  Irish and Hazelnut Cold Coffee - Most places I have tried Cold Coffee, the flavour has always got mixed and it's been difficult to make out. But the cold coffee here has the perfect taste of flavours and its strong aswell. Just how coffee should be.  Blueberry Cheesecake - So they make the cheesecake with pure Mascaporne cheese and Biscotti as the base. Also, they use real berries as the topping and not just berry syrup. All this makes the Cheesecake one of the most authentic pastries. This cheesecake beat some of the best patisserie's in town. Its hands down the BEST!  Belgian Truffle Pastry - It's a perfect melt in the mouth pastry, which such dense flavour of Belgian chocolate. The best part if you melt this pastry, it can become a perfect ganache.

Next, I ordered veg and chicken vada paos, the veg one was too dry but the chicken one made up for a good starter.   For the mains I had Kodi koora with Malabari Parantha and Appam.

I also tried their Mutton Biryani, it was served in a coconut shell and was really good.   I ended my meal on a sweet note with their Murgan Chocolate Bomb, loaded with nuts.

We ordered the following-  Paan Flavoured Nariyal Paani- An exciting twist to the regular coconut water, though the paan flavour was too much but it was worth a try.  Malay Laksa soup- Probably the best coconut base soup I've ever had with four different kinds of toppings in various bowls and packed with flavour, a must must order.  Chicken Cafreal- The classic goan chicken with little bit of coconut touch and amazing chicken pieces.  Fish Koliwada- The Maharastrian style fish and chips, not too spicy not too bland which goes perfectly with thr chutney.  Appam Stew Chicken- The appams are perfectly cooked and the stew is outstanding too but the chicken could've been more flavourful.  Classic Goan Prawn Curry- A safe bet wherever you go and here also it didn't disappoint at all with a small quantity of rice served with the goan curry.

I loved how they give personalised coconuts to serve coconut water in. It makes for a good souvenir to take back home!  The peach and mango coconut water was a refreshing welcome. I started of with their special: Malay laksa soup which was simply too good.  I forgot the name of the Salad I had here but it was really good. Their Vada pao was a little bit of a let down. It was too dry. The Chicken pao however, was really yummy. Would recommend it. The mains had Kodi koora, Appam, Malabari parantha and Mutton biryani. The presentation of the meal was decent but the food was absolutely delicious.  The kodi koora tasted better with appam than with the malabari parantha. The dessert I ordered was the Chocolate dome which had a coconut surprise inside. It was loaded with chocolate syrup and dry fruits.  Would love to visit again. Keep up the good work, team.']"

And the reason given - “their management had not opened the screenshots sent by their CEO correctly, they just checked the preview and since in the preview of the picture veg main course was not mentioned so they did not prepare it. Our agony didnt stop there. Being in the hospitality industry, these guys didnt have simmer nor any equipments to keep the warm (that fuel thiny, i dont know what its called). Anywasy they didnt have and because of which food got cold soggy and when we told them about this, they were like “Aadhey ghantey se khana laga rakha hai” With a audience of around 100 people its really hard to push all of the guests together for the lunch, some were dancing, some were chit chatting, some were clicking pictures, etc. So we cannot expect the guests to listen to the host obediently. Anyways, towards the end they ran out of food. I had given them a confirmation of around 95 people and i think food for 50 people was also not prepared.

The chairs were not kept properly, cleaning had not been done, lighting was properly done, basically nothing was done. My team member himself aligned the chairs with their staff and pretty much helped them in managing everything. And Mr. X reminded us of the time. They ran out of the food and when they took more time in serving they refused to serve the food to the host, and said that according to the terms , the time limit has exceeded so we cannot serve the food. Now tell me guys, when the host is taking care of all the guests, how is he supposed to eat between all this? and that too when these guys are running out of each and every food item that they promised to give.On top of all this, there was no one for clearing the dirty tables, no one was there at the water counter to serve water to the guests.

Nice place to hangout with friends at night and have fun 👍🏼', ""Named creatively to meld sports bar and lounge, Slounge belongs to that sub-genre of retro sports bar serving straight forward liquor and comfort food. The best way to enjoy this chic bar in Lemon Tree Premier, Aerocity with its relaxed seating, Retro posters and billiards table is to dress casual and immerse yourself in old-school music!  Speaking of my visit, I headed to the pub at 8 with buddies. The team welcomed us, made us comfortable and we took the reserved corner table after admiring the retro wall. It's these small, significant gestures that make the experience delightful. Perusing the menu, I ordered Vodka and my health-conscious friends chose to go with fresh juice. We then ordered aggressively as we were all tired and hungry after a day packed with meetings. The manager answered queries and made thoughtful suggestions so pretty soon we settled back amid giggles and animated conversation.  Soon, the dishes were served. Up first was 'Shikampuri Kebab', seared to give a hint of doneness and melt-in-the-mouth texture. I can confidently say the ground lamb patties is better than any I've had in Hyderabad, surprisingly light and intensely flavored. Next, 'Nimbu Achari Jheenga' was off- the- hook fresh. The jumbo prawns rubbed with lime and spices was easily star of the evening, as it satiated hunger pangs and murmurs of satisfaction were involuntary elicited! Since we were all sea- foodies, we were looking forward to the next one too: 'Oats and Flax Breaded Fish Fingers.' The fish, breaded in oatmeal and flaxseeds, was deep-fried, piping hot, sumptuous… and demolished in no time! The perfect bar snack!! As time wore on, the Vodka was potent, the retro music foot tappin'… and then the vegetarian dishes arrived. 'Steamed Silken Tofu With Lemon Chilli Garlic' released a bouquet of flavours and was purr-fect comfort food! 'Broccoli and Rose Petal Shammi' is one of their signatures and unlike anything I've had! If you're a vegetarian, and even if you're not, you must try it! I was looking forward to the last one, 'Grilled Button Mushroom’, since I'm a fan of shrooms. And I was not disappointed. The flavour of the fine mushrooms was heightened with roasted chilli sauce. Simply sumptuous!!  Thoughts that stayed with me when we walked out at 11 p.m. was that there's a tradition at Slounge—to ensure guests leave with memories of fine cocktails, flavourful snacks, get-up-and-dance music… embellished with excellent service and attractive pricing. A must-visit at any hour. Cheers!!"", 'Had a beautiful experience of hosting our mom dad 40th anniversary party here and watta party it was! Extra caring service and yummilicious food. Lebanese chicken and kaleji were the best. Mr. Rajat attention to minute details were commendable. Surely, getting back here soon for another party.']"

Now, that doesn’t mean that perfection is lesser than Passion. When it comes to food, presentation, innovation, and taste; Chefs have plenty of new ideas to play with. And each idea is a hit because of it getting curated and crafted in the best possible manner. There are two options for guest during lunch hours that end at 3 pm.

The place is awesome with decent ambience and fancy crowd.', 'I was in the mood to unwind, and ended up being in one of my favourite areas- Khan Market. I didn’t really want to eat anything; just a drink would do. So after walking through the all too familiar lanes, I decided to head to Smoke House Deli for two reasons: 1) I’ve been to their other outlets and really like their food and ambience, and 2) they had happy hours going on! The place wasn’t too crowded when I entered (then again it was around 6.30pm), which perfectly suited me. They serve a complimentary bread basket with a delicious assortment of breads with herbed butter. To drink, I ordered one Whiskey Sour, which tasted great! (Thanks to the happy hour, I got two for the price of one). Now being the foodie that I am, I couldn’t resist ordering something to eat as well. So I ordered their vegetarian curried lasagne. Although it was prepared well, it seemed like an Indian tomato gravy was used for the lasagne (like how Shahi Paneer would taste). It turns out, the word “curried” in the name of the dish signifies that the tomato sauce would be Indianised, so of course the lasagne tasted like it was made from Shahi Paneer gravy! If you like this sort of flavour, you’ll enjoy the lasagne. I didn’t know this earlier, and since I prefer my lasagne Italian rather than Indian, I requested the staff to have it changed. I really appreciate that they offered me to replace it with something else on the menu. So I decided to go for half-and-half pizza, where one part was olive and mushroom, and the other was Caponata with Manchego and Feta. Totally loved the pizza, especially the Caponata one (it was loaded with veggies and cheese!). The crust of the pizza was so crispy even until the last bite of the pizza! Let’s just say my unwind 101 was successful. Staff was courteous and service was prompt. Would totally recommend checking this place out if you haven’t already.', 'We had a scrumptious lunch at this outlet, specifically the Mushroom Stroganoff and Spaghetti Arrabbiata!

Their other reason for the policy is because others are doing it., which is a great way of shedding responsibility and accountability, particularly in India!. I have been to this place numerous time and adults have been equally loud and boisterous if not more than any kid I have seen. Spoils the whole idea of ""family"" experience.
