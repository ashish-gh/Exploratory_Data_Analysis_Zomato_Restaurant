Apple virgin mojito  The drinks/moctails are not so great at this place. The drinks we had here were really really sweet. The best among all the drinks is the Apple virgin mojito which really makes it a must try.  Main course  ---------------  1. Dal makhani   2. Paneer khurchan (special)  3. Malai kofta  4.

We ordered food and the bill was generated. People working at the restro didn't say a word about the food. We waited for 20 mins but the food didn't come.

The dishes are fine, nothing special but since they go easy on the pocket, they serve the purpose. The interiors are very basic but again in the given price bracket, they are fine. I always take the seat by the windowside so as to get the view of the busy street of Karol Bagh and the market. Since it located in the heart of the KB market and is quite close to the metro station so after having the supper, it is convenient to shop and catch the Metro back home.  Although there is self-service it doesn\u2019t feel bothersome because Raffels is rarely too crowded, which doesn\u2019t make it awkward to carry the tray to the table.

This is more of your Desi burgers with spices and flavors added accordingly. I love many of their burgers and I have been regular eating at the outlet and also ordering at home. So here is a brief:  1) United States of Punjab burger is the best for me.  2) They have economical burgers as well and they do taste good.  3) I'm not fond of the ice tea we get there.  4) The service is too slow and therefore, I prefer ordering rather visiting the outlet.   5) VFM definitely!": "18454460", "Before talking about the food I would like to give up a Thumbs up for packaging.

Then the owner guy was casual like nothing happened and started to count the pieces of broccoli in my chowmein. And he was able to count two pieces and gave me excuse that \"nahi hai\" nahi to ladke daal dete.. I was like, you should refuse to serve things that you don't have.

I enjoyed a lot and the staff was really good nd the food is very delicious .": "18204820", "Visited them last month. On entering, you realise that the indoor seating area is not that spacious. I wanted to be seated outdoors, but then it's only allowed for dinner time. I wasn't very taken by the ambiance.  Coming to the food, I opted for the non-vegetarian buffet option. For drinks, I chose a litchi based mocktail. You could also go for beer or whisky which I think I should have chosen too, now that I think of it. But there's no use crying over spilled milk now. So coming back to my litchi mocktail, let me say it was awesome. Tart and sweet and zingy. Was a pleasant accompaniment to the starters. I really liked the chilly fish, chicken tikka, crispy corn. Cajun potatoes lacked that kick and mutton seekh was really dry. The paneer tikka too wasn't flavourful enough. And the pizza base was very tough.  The main course was so delicious. I am a manchow soup lover. And I helped myself to bowls of the veg manchow soup. Then I came across chicken hot and sour soup and gobbled that up too. I also tried different salads I think you could and should skip them. The chicken biryani and mutton rogan josh warmed up my soul with their distinctly spiced flavours. The biryani deserves special mention with the overwhelming aroma of whole spices and chunky chicken pieces. The rogan josh curry was hot and spicy and I was satisfied then and there. Nevertheless, greed occupied me again while going through other dishes and this time I helped myself to hakka chowmein and stir fried veggies in basil chilly sauce (yeah it's veg. Don't be surprised). The veggie gravy was utterly savoury and had so much going on. Sweet, sour, salty, that fresh basil hit. And by then I realised I was almost full and had to end my main course eating spree.  Coming to desserts, gulab jamuns were soul warming. The chocolate pastry was lush and bitter and kept me wanting more. The tarts were creamy and crumbley. Delicious. Moong dal halwa was all ghee and nuts and heavenly. And the strawberry ice cream was creamy and screamed fresh strawberries and not the artificial colour and flavour stuff.  Overall, it was a decent experience. Although I think cutting out the live music part during afternoons wouldn't be a bad idea afterall. It felt kinda loud and claustrophobic. The service was not bad. The prices were moderate. I paid 1300+ for two non-veg lunch buffets.": "18204820", "Enjoyed a wide range of dishes at this buffet outlet with aesthetic interiors and designer exteriors.
