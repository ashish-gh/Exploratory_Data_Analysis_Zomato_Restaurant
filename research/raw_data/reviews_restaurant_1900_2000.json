Ah... \ud83d\ude1b \ud83d\ude0b \ud83d\ude0d That was nice .. .  2nd visit - we were 4, we had  1 grilled sandwich,  2 burgers,  1 pizza n  cold drink...  .  Everything else was average, burgers were better than everything else, sandwich was the normal coleslaw sandwich and he grilled that... ..nothing special..  The pizza was not at all good, actually the boy working there, maybe he didn't know how to prepare a pizza... He took the pizza base, added sauce n toppings (it ws like a sabzi of onion, tomato n capsicum mixed in pizza sauce) and microwaved it for 2 minutes n served... Instead of using the oven mode, me used the microwave mode... And that made the pizza base chewy, it was horrible. So after having a bite or 2 we realised it wasn't prepared properly, n we complained of it.!  The owner ws understanding enough to exclude that from the bill...  .

Putting the chocolate in your mouth and just as you start to chew YOU CANNOT BELIEVE THAT CHOCOLATES AS BRILLIANT AS THIS EXISTED.  5. Vow to completely cease the purchase of any other chocolate for there is NO COMPARISON OF ANY CHOCOLATE TO THIS. 6.

A wide range of cakes and pasteries are on the menu. I landed while going home. So a quick bite for a mutton roll and dal makhani and some pasteries were on the platter. To suggest if u wanna grab a quick roll opt for the mutton rather than chicken. As they are limited to seekh rolls. For pasteries dey have daily new itenary for pasteries so suggest to head up nd choose urself. As far as the dal is concerned have a mixed feeling. Since the dal makhani is a common item nd every restaurant has on its menu. Here it was shahi dal makhani. U ll get confused between dal makhani , shahi paneer gravy and butter chicken gravvy.

Alu-pyaz, paneer and mix parathas are good enough to sooth Vegetarian's taste buds. But the show stopper is the keema paratha.
