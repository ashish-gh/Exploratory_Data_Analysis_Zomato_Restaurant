16668008,i love arigato sushi!!!! the best restaurant in yorkton! they are always serving a delicious food and service is good. the price is not bad. my fav roll is crazy roll!!! but they are not enough for big table but it is okey to having fun with family time!  Family Eats Friend
16668008,"Was in Yorkton on a work trip and decided to try a few local spots. The sushi was ok, tuna smelled a little odd. The beef short ribs were tough and hard to eat but did have good flavour. Restaurant was clean. Service was overall ok."
16668008,"Had a sushi supper last week. The waitress was attentive and very nice. Although it isn't huge inside, we fit into a booth and were quite comfortable. The sushi was made fresh, the rolls were delicious and the nigiri was good as well.¬†  We ordered the sushi tray 'b', maki combo, and unagi rolls, while the kids also enjoyed the chicken teriyaki meal and udong soup. We had started with the tako yaki (battered octopus) and it was great, done differently then I expected but I would have again.  We do wish they would have had a better mixed sushi combo available. But we worked it out, topped it off with a sapporo and we were stuffed!¬†Overall I was impressed at the sushi in Yorkton."
16668008,"I was travelling trough and called in my order for Pick-up, ¬†I never stayed to eat in the restaurant, seems ok at a glance and staff appeared friendly. ¬† Ordered the assorted sushi combo (spicy maki) and I was pleasantly surprised. ¬†All seafood nigiri and no sweet egg or bean curd, ¬†I don't care for those 2. ¬†If I was staying in Yorkton I would eat here again and I would definitely call in an order for pick up again while passing through."
16668008,"Delicious Food.. Yorkton isn't exactly known for its food and it can definitely be difficult to find variety, much less variety that is as good as this. The restaurant itself isn't really anything special, aside from the waitresses, who dress is traditional garb.... But looks can be deceiving and the food here is amazing. I tried several items on the menu, ranging from sushi to stir-fried noodles with beef and soup, as well as tempura, and all of it was delicious. The portions were quite large as well.  I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for something a little different.... If you're a fan of sushi or want to give it a try, they have a lot to choose from and you won't be disappointed. The prices ""seem"" a bit high for the sushi but you really do get large portions... And even if you're not a fan of sushi or have no interest in trying it, they have plenty of other options to choose from."
801690,"I just Simply love This Place.....It is ideal for Breakfast.....Lunch.....Dinner....All three meals....and For Snacking Off course. Their Shakes,Coffees And All The preparations are top quality and full of flavours.   The Only shortcoming is that it is not Pocket Friendly...And people Who don‚Äôt SMOKE HUKKAH might feel uncomfortable üò£.......else the Open Air view is Really Beautiful.   Ignoring the Drawbacks.....This Place is Excellent.   RECOMMENDED üòä"
801690,"I have been to this place thrice.  Everytime it has been a great experience. Quite huge and lively place. Loved the ambience and the interiors.   Service and food were exceptionally great.  Also, this place is always crowded, so you might have to wait to get a place to dine."

17558738,"Delicious. There's not a single dish i've tried at Blue House that is offensive on the palette. They have a very family feel to their service, and even though we only go once a month, they always recognize us with a smile. They remember just how we want our mint tea (brown sugar please!) they know just how much organic syrup to put on our crepes. They are most definitely a great atmosphere with even better cuisine!"
17558738,"Fresh food!! This is how food should be made! Very clean and the beer is great!  -----26 Mar, 2011----- They brew there own beer and the food is fresh!!!"
16611701,"A lot of food and many varieties, some of the sushi is not fresh. Love the many desserts to eat especially the Portuguese tart. Very cheap if you live in Citigate motel as you get 10% Off to eat at the buffet.  Overall, a good place to eat with your family."
16611701,"Fantastic and good quality food, lots of seafood and various meat dishes, a great place to go to with kids. The Asian dishes are probably the most authentic, among all the all you can eat places in Newcastle..."
16611701,"Had a birthday lunch for a cousin last Sunday, hoping for a great day. Food is mediocre and not much choice. Dessert is not impressive. We couldn't eat all we can, because we easily got sick of the taste of the food. We only chose this restaurant because it's closer to home. We should have chosen to travel a bit farther, so long as we'd have a really great day and delectable lunch. The worst part of our lunch was our encounter with a fair-skinned Chinese-looking customer service male staff named ""Linus"". We requested him nicely to take us a photo, so that we could all be in a photo as a souvenir of that birthday lunch. To our dismay, he refused, saying he's busy. Then, he stood next to the cashier doing nothing. Five minutes later, he passed by our table. For the second time, we requested him to take us a photo. Again, he said, he's too busy. He tried to push a chair near our table even if the chair didn't need to be pushed, then stood again next to the cashier doing nothing. We would understand his refusal if he was really busy. But there were only a few tables occupied at that time (around 11:45 am). It wasn't too busy at all. He didn't even respond to us in a friendly manner. He was RUDE. He was avoiding us as if we have a contagious disease, just like what other racists do. He probably doesn't like Spanish-looking people or dark-skinned customers like asians. He is asian, too, but fair-skinned. In fairness, there was a female staff named ""Quhyn"" who took us a couple of photos later. I made my written complaint to the management on that day about the rudeness of ""Linus"". So, if you are dark-skinned, and decide to dine in that mediocre restaurant, and if you want to have a group photo, try to ask ""Linus"" to do it. If he will be rude to you, that means the management didn't teach him how to be an effective and efficient customer service staff. Then, it is up to you if you still want to support a restaurant that employs rude staff. You might want to try another ""eat all you can"" restaurant - Billabongs Family Restaurant inside East Maitland Bowling Club at the corner of Banks Street and New England Highway, East Maitland, NSW. They have more food choices there and friendly and helpful staff."
16611701,"Value for money, and lovely asian and dessert."
16611701,"I went there on a Sunday night just recently. First time in over a year and found the qualitly of food has gone downhill, quite disappointing really.  It all looks lovely but tasted terrible. Seafood had been frozen so had little flavour. The salads were not fresh. Plenty of effort put into the deep fried food which is ok if you don't care about your waistline!  The staff are everywhere and are very helpful and tentative.  Unfortunate we won't be going back unless they review their food quality and have it changed."
2100784,11th avenue cafe has always been my favorite..loved the cheesy meaty fries here..it was in the month of February when things were better.. looking forward to brighter days to grab a coffee here soon.
2100784,Been there with friends. loved their yummy chicken burger and the sandwich..lovely ambience along with good food i must say...
2100784,If you are into continental dishes then this is the ideal place you should be... early risers can come here for breakfast dates because the breakfast here is really the best one...and do follow me on Instagram for more @foodiehoodie2020
801269,One of the oldest cafe near my house . I started going there from my school daysss. I love this place .. One of the best shake and coffee they provide.. Ambiance is very attractive... Staff is friendly and cooperative.. I have visited there with my friend.. They also like this place.. Cappuccino was great. I will suggest everyone to come here and enjoy...
801269,The lasagna is really tasty and worth trying it! It is like real Italian pasta! Congratulations to the team and cooks of VM for  making the effort to bring truly international recipes. Pancakes are also real good! And the menu is varied and very good!
801269,The service has declined by many folds at this restaurant. Food got served after an hour and in that too not all items were present as mentioned in menu.
18483082,"Great ambience here.. I am here supporting, Cosmic Armchair Contact Album Launch.. venue provides decent sound system. The finger food served are in decent proportions. Service staff are polite and attentive."
18483082,Had a crab burger
18483082,I found this outlet on zomato...Nice beautiful and relaxing place to visit... Staff was good and served nicely... I ordered tandoori chicken tasty one and nicely served with fries on side good place to visit...
18483082,Tried tandoor chicken and authentic belgian waffle from artistry. Tandoori chicken was flavorful with perfect balance of spices. Waffle was good too
18483082,"I have been there with my family a lot of times, and found out that this restaurant will give you the best sorts of snacks and baked items ever in whole Singapore. I loved the momos and specially pastry. I suggest everyone to check out this place."
18483252,A good place to hangout with family and friends... Nice ambience with cool setting arrange... Book your reservation if you don't want to wait ... Nice food and very well behave staff..
18483252,"Located within walking distance of Bugis or Bencoolen MRT on Middle Street, you can miss it easily unless you look slightly inside the sidewalk. Please make reservation (we had to wait an hour). It is not the swanky type of restaurant. Seating outside and inside. Inside also it is not cool. Old furniture. Service slow (because they are very busy). It looks more like a bar and cafe. But all drawbacks are made up by the excellent food. Beer is very expensive and small mug. A variety of drinks are available. But for the excellent Mediterranean food, pita bread and falafal are not available. But good in-house made bread is served. Portions are small and shareable. Go to this place only if you have plenty of time on hand."
18483252,"Had baklava ice cream sandwich. Been a fan of ice cream. This dessert is worth dying for. A must recommend ice cream dessert in Victoria, Rochor"
18483252,Ambience here is super awesome I'm with good sitting arrangements had a lunch with my friend and I am sure I will go again and again because of great service and great food
16615894,"In a rainy day walking in as a disabled person I was unable to stand long on my feet. Young family with a child walked in, pushed us aside and got all the attention from staff and owner as we were pushed aside to stand under the rain. Nobody was paying  any attention to us. After they accomodated this family, they finally turned to us. As owner explained that family is coming every day so they look after them first. What an attitude towards people with disabilities. Sorry one star."
16615894,Great breakfast sitting in the morning winter sun. Very good service. Coffee great.Wife happy with presentation of her long black (see photo) Breakfast arrived timely and was a very good price. Wishing we lived nearby so that we could visit often.
16615894,"Went for breakfast on our last day in Caloundra, and was not disappointed! I had a fantastic pancake type with naan bread, eggs and bacon. My wife had muesli which was soaked in apple juice rather than milk. Both meals were amazing. Most of the meals had a combination of eggs and bacon. The place was packed when we got there around 8 AM. They had a small number of tables inside, and a larger number outside. The place was very lively and busy. The service was good too, although most of the wait staff looked quite young they were very professional. It was a little hard to know who the staff were as there was no common uniform. We tried to get a coffee to take away when we paid, but the power had gone out so we had to pay with cash and their coffee machine wasn't working."
16615894,"Great service, great food, great price. No need to say more. This place is awesome has a wonderful atmosphere. The owner is bright and genuine, highly recommended üëçüëçüëç"
16615894,"This cafe was right opposite where we were staying and it was honestly the highlight of our mornings! The staff were so friendly to us and they even had dog treats for visiting dogs :) My friends and I all agreed their coffee was amazing, especially their lattes!"
16605194,Underwhelming food. Expensive. Cosy Aussie pub atmosphere and friendly staff but couldn't provide reliable information about dishes. Pretty good wine list.
16605194,It was extremely hard to find anything open in Kyneton on a Monday night nevertheless we‚Äôre so happy we found this place. It‚Äôs the perfect country pub and the food is seriously good!
16605194,I cannot believe that this establishment charges a ridiculous $3 for a sauce in steak WTF?? For Christ sake just make it one price and if someone doesn't want a sauce then you're $3 better off geeezus!   P√¢t√© was good as was steak but all soured by a petty $3 sauce charge!!!   Locals don't tolerate this sort of behavior
16605194,"Delicious food and really friendly staff. We just came back from Easter Sunday lunch, full and content. The Guinness on tap was the highlight."
16605194,Great country pub. Service was fast and very friendly. Menu is a little limited but everything was rated very good by my group. The hand made chicken and leek pies were delicious as was the prawn and Atlantic salmon linguini. To top it off there is a good choice of wines and beer available and the pints of Guinness were very reasonably priced.
16605794,"I order a smash avo that is totally dark avocado. And I told their staff, they just told me that is the only one they have, they didn‚Äôt apologize just give me the unreasonable excuse. Too terrible service attitude, no food safety awareness."
16605794,"Tucked right off the Esplanade on Meyer St, Lakes Entrance is a very popular Cafe. Opens at 8am and gets pretty busy right after. We were there at 8:10am and was lucky to find the last table, while seeing others been told to come back later.  Food is pretty good and fairly priced. My initial impression from the name of the Cafe was to expect some innovative and funky menu, however that isn't the case and menu is standard run of the mill. Coffee was pretty good and so was the hot cake with maple, kids loved it.  Surely worth a try when you are in this beautiful part of Victoria."
16605794,"Undeniably the best coffee shop in lakes entrance. In such a small cute town knowing that there‚Äôs a reliable coffee shop where both locals and tourists stop by is a must in my book!   Ordered:  regular mocha $4.5  Apple custard   Review:  Delicious mocha which a nice balance of coffee and chocolate. This was my first time drinking mocha as I‚Äôm always a cappuccino or latte type of person but it‚Äôs honestly soooo good. The apple custard was flavourful with fresh tart apples cooked down and folded in with the moist pastry. Inside was a rich custard, although I would‚Äôve liked the custard to be a bit more smooth."
16605794,"Best coffee in town. And it seems to be a fairly popular place with the locals and tourists alike, judging by the crowds every day of the week!"
16604358,"Overall, Blue Bean is okay. We came here on a Saturday morning just before it became busy - obviously a popular place to go. The service was great. However, the food was not what you‚Äôd expect from a 4.5 star rated cafe. Also quite a small menu with not a lot of options? I had the blue bean breakfast - eggs with bacon and tomato. The bacon was cooked quite well, however, the meal just lacked any excitement. It was also quite expensive for what you received."
16604358,"bad food, very high prices for what you get.  packet waffles with frozen berries, $6.30 coffee. got some extra mushrooms for $4, got 3 charred, dry mushrooms $1.33 each üëç I have no idea what was going on with the hash brown, worth a visit to try to figure out how they made made that oily chewy cube.  just go to any other place in Daylesford"
16604358,"The coffees and the venue itself were great but that's where it stops. The food was super bland, bacon was fatty and it came with a small piece of toast. Not worth the $21 paid for each dish."
16604358,"Chilled cafe serving great coffee. Visited on a sunny Sunday afternoon, not too busy so it was a nice place to chill out. Ordered the sourdough toast and a decaf coffee. Sourdough was slightly burnt but not so much that it wasn‚Äôt edible. Would have liked it more if it was just a little less done. Decaf was great.  The veg breakfast was good, not great. Just needed seasoning... a little oil or salt or a little herbs. All the produce looked fresh but on its own just needed a bit of help to increase the flavour.  Staff were great, very friendly and welcoming.  Rating was probably more of a 3.5... but certainly not a 4 for the food. Coffee was a 4 üòä"
17534788,"The Chef has created incredible dishes. Breakfast, lunch and dinner were a delight.  These all have a southwestern flair with locally grown produce. The hamburgers are huge!  I wish the Artesian was a local option for me. Make reservations as seating is limited in the dining room.  The bar area has several higher tables with food."
17534788,Calm down with the salt. Even the bread is too salty
17534788,"Normally A Superior Restaurant. I am presently staying at Ojo Caliente, which is a fantastic resort. I have eaten at this restaurant at least five times on this visit and found it to be be a truly great restaurant. for some reason, the meal this evening was truly snake-bit. The steak was over-cooked and I inedible. The desert was stale. I will give it one more try, but if I'm served another meal like this, I'll bring my food with me the next time I visit this truly lovely resort."
17534788,"Breakfast is the Best. They have this one dish that is poblano chiles stuffed with a fancy sausage and then smothered in a tasty sauce. Excellent way to start the day. The service is always friendly and quick, and we never feel rushed to leave."
17534788,"Amazing food, down to earth staff, comfy atmosphere. My trout and hubby's steak were probably the best we've had. I loved all the veggies with both dishes. Portions were just right, too. The"
16606299,Fantastic food and coffee! We had breaky twice and morning tea. The service was great and the food was delicious. Will definitely come back ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
16606299,"Such a good place! We came here both days of our weekend getaway from Melbourne. Would definitely recommend. Good simple food, decent coffee, nice atmosphere outside with rugs for patrons, dog beds and toys for kids. Service is great and they have a great selection of cakes & slices."
16606299,"Very quant and cozy. Absolutely delicious coffee. Interesting sweet treats like the cookies & cream cheesecake & malteesers bar.  Friendly staff.  Though the bathroom is clean, its very untidy and disorganised."
16606299,"Good place to relax and enjoy the food! We ordered beach box burger and chicken schnitzel. The burger is coming with ""bad boy"" chips which is a very interesting name. Just one little thing : The beef inside the burger is too thick for me but others may like it."
16606299,Only stopped here for a coffee and tea.  Double shot skinny flat white was average too milky and not strong enough.  My tea however had leaves and was hot which ticks both my boxes.  Typical breakfast menu but pricey compared to great places we have eaten at in Melbourne and surrounds- I was going to say you are paying for the view but that is nondescript.  Busy when we were there but it was 10am on a Sunday.
16654702,"We tried to make a reservastion chose not to go to this restaurant.¬† We were given a substantial anniversary gift certificate.¬† We were willing to book for the first seating at 4 to ensure a window seat... they could not guarantee it.¬† Why would this be?¬† Are they holding seats for friends or possible popular customers...¬† The entire ""policy"" makes absolutely no sense.¬† I do not appreciate being told this over and over on the phone by a seemingly 20 year old who has no concept of fine dining.¬† This should be a concern to the management."
16654702,Been here several times and love this place! Food never fails to deliver exactly what I wanted and the view!! Just stunning. Love patio season at this spot off the QEW.
16654702,"As it suggests, it‚Äôs right on Lake Ontario. Very nice ambiance, they also have an outside patio during the summer. I was with friends and everyone had a great meal. I had escargot as an app, very tasty and Fish (sorry cant remember type) over sausage and a variety of veg. Also quite tasty. Would highly recommend!"
16654702,"I have been driving to Niagara Falls once a year for the last 7 or so years.¬† Every year I notice this restaurant and every year I say I want to try it out.¬† This year was the year.¬† I booked with OpenTable and headed on over.  I had a warm reception upon arriving and was shown to a table by the window overlooking Lake Ontario.¬† It was a nice clear evening and was able to enjoy a nice sunset while eating.¬† The ambiance was nice and the whole experience from the moment I arrived to the moment I left was incredible.  I chose my meal based on the fixed price menu.¬† If the soup had not been mushroom, i would have had that, so i opted for a Caesar salad.¬† I have to say it was delicious.¬† The unique croutons were also very good.¬† I had the Moroccan Lamb Shank braised with dates and exotic spices. It was incredibly flavourful.¬† The meat melted in my mouth.¬† It was a big meal so when they came out with a choice of mini dessert, it hit the spot without being overly big.  All in all I would most definitely come back and eat here again.¬† It is worth the detour."
16654702,"Garbage.  Poor service, uneducated staff and serving frozen fish at a premium price with sides from a  steam table  no where near the value of the prices. When asked if the vegetarian curry was spicy, was Informed that the meat made it spicy.....what meat?   Nice view though"
17694056,"I went here with a party of 12. We had a fantastic waitress, named Andrea. She was very attentive even though the restaurant was pretty busy. The food was really good with one exception, the Greek lasagna. The lasagna had an odd herb that didn't taste good to several in our party that sampled it. It was also a little over cooked. We explained to our waitress that we didn't care for it. One of the owners came to our table and apologized for it being unacceptable to us. He then ask what we would like to replace it with. Great customer service! All the other food from broccoli chicken spaghetti in garlic sauce to the stuffed pepper sandwich was delicious.  The restaurant is in a new building and has a very nice decor. Well worth stopping."
17694056,"Food is awesome!! Have had nothing that was below par. Owner visits each table and greets all of the guests, makes you feel like he really cares about his patrons and his business. A real class act."
17694056,"First off , the new location is great. The size of the new location adds a spacious touch that is less cramped and offers more privacy for the customers. The dimming lights offer a relaxed environment and the crowd is always delightful. The food: The food is always made to order fresh, the prices are reasonable and the quality is key. Lastly is the the customer service / server experience: I have visited this place at least 8-10 times and have experienced almost every server there , but there is one individual that stands out from the rest. She carried herself very well and offered and professional, polite and pleasant experience to this whole dining experience. I believe her name is Laurianne. She is very knowledgeable and can carry on a great conversation. She has great qualities that is sure to lead her to many opportunities."
17694056,"Theo Yianni's is a new-ish Greek restaurant in Weirton that has been receiving rave reviews since its opening. It broke ground about six years ago¬†and has been a real force in revitalizing the community.And while you might be scratching your head thinking - ""Greek? In Weirton?"" It isn't all that surprising to me. There's the Greek festival in Weirton, hosted at the Greek Orthodox church. I know of a few Greek families, and there's a delicious Greek restaurant right across the river in Ohio. So, there's a framework in which to operate here.This restaurant is located on Pennsylvania Avenue in a building that I hadn't been to before. There's a bit of parking nearby, so no worries there. The restaurant itself is broken into a few different dining spaces; it looks as though they may have expanded into spaces in the adjoining areas. The interior is simple, but cozy at the same time.So, we picked a seat, and a friendly waitress approached us with menus. Grape leaves, spanakopita, tiropita (Greek cheese pie) and a Grecian roll (cucumber, tomato, feta, tzatziki and balsamic rolled into pita bread) all file under the appetizer section. Greek salads and avgolemono soup (chicken, lemon and rice) are available for lighter fare. Sandwiches include a gyro, pork souvlaki, burgers, grilled chicken, panini, fish, chili dog, and a few Pittsburgh-esque sandwiches. Also, they have a few platters if you're going for the low-carb option.Well, my guess is they need a little bit of everything to appease everyone, so you can get some authentic dishes here and then burgers for the meat-and-potatoes guy. But, if you're wanting a true taste of Greek food in Weirton, get the gyro, which is a blend of lamb and beef, tomatoes, onions, and tzatziki on pita bread. I also upgraded my fries to the ""Greek fries,"" which are fresh-cut fries with fresh feta and oregano.Wow, this is GOOD. Tender meat cooked on a spit, topped with these spears of tomato, and all drenched in tzatziki sauce - a really good one at that. Everything was fresh, perfectly proportioned and tasty. The salty meat, the slight sweetness of the onion, the creamy sauce, the sturdy pita to pull it all together. And the fries - just look at that mountain of fresh feta. Perfectly crisp with all the light cheese. Delish."
17694056,What a great find for us in Weirton. The grape leaves appetizer was very fresh and tasty. ¬†The friendly staff was very familiar with the menu . The lamb and chicken gyros were delicious and there was no skimping on any ingredients. The greek fries with the feta smothered over them were awesome. ¬† Will definitely visit again prior to the opening of their brand new location in october that is under construction.
3700050,So one of the cutest yet expensive place i have visited so far. We tried Mushroom Quiche and it was my first time of trying Quiche and trust me i feel in love right there with those Mushroom Quiche. Really good. Yummmicliously delicious. Enjoyed. We also tried few other things but everything was slightly expensive than what we normally we pay for.
3700050,"This place has a variety of foods, french style. Located in the center, taste is good, price is all worth"
3700050,"We came here for our midnight cravings .. It‚Äôs French style bakery where u get sandwiches, cakes and croissants . The food here is on the expensive side . We had a croissant and a creek br√ªl√©e and a pastry Not sure what the other dish we was called . But would definitely go back to try other things ."
3700050,"Had butter and chocolate croissant here, I have had best croissant here so far. Its so fresh, little crispy and soft at the same time."
17629582,What a great little place right out of a motorcycle commercial!   - or at least it should be. Cool place. Great people and my fish tacos were really good!
18366580,Really friendly staff and fast service. Big menu with tons of pictures that made me just want to order one of everything! The mango topped California rolls were great. The spicy tuna rolls were so good and so spicy (be ready for it!) and the white cabin rolls were so good wit the perfect amount of crunch and textures in each bite. The salmon sashimi looked absolutely incredible and tasted amazing. I would recommend checking it out if you are in Cochrane !
18366580,"Super friendly service, they were really attentive.  The sushi was good quality, I would recommend the pork gyoza, chopped scallop roll and salmon battera sushi."
18366580,"Love this place, I'd pick this over the other sushi place in town. Love the atmosphere and the customer service is great. Love the sake ceasar drink as well. Been here a few times now and highly recommend"
18366580,Lovely place. Great service! Great environment! I was surprised at the quality of food here. There's many japanese restaurants in Cochrane and I've heard great things abiut Sakura so I decided to give it a try and it definitely did not disappoint.
18366580,Sushi was ok. They have a big menu but most things we had were average. Miso soup not as good as I've had other places. Took forever to get our food and the dishes came out sporadically.
17211719,"Great seafood spot. Nice variety of main dishes and selection of fish, as well as good side dishes. Attentive staff. BYOB when it comes to alcohol."
17211719,Excellent seafood restaurant. Everything here is high quality and delicious. A bit pricey but if you want good quality seafood and good service you usually need to pay for it. This is my go to place for seafood. Note The restaurant can be a little loud when busy so don't expect a quiet romantic spot.
17211719,Good good place but was a tad disappointed to get an under-cooked bass fillet. Not expected from this place to say the least. But really quality food. Could improve a bit on their service.
17211719,"Delicious! I had the bouillabaisse, one friend had √©touff√© and the others had fish dishes. Close your eyes pick anything on the menu and I think you'll be pretty happy. I dined with three friends, we were all pleased."
17211719,"Awesome dinner. Grabbed a later reservation on Friday (thanks to Urban Spoon). Had a fantastic time. Dinner was outstanding. Excellent service, very prompt and friendly. Server made great suggestions and really helped make the meal even better.   2nd time we have been there, cannot wait to go back."
9417,This place has been best cafe finds ! I never knew there‚Äôs a cafe in the wishing chair store and now I just come back for this cute cafe.   It‚Äôs a tiny space but packs a punch! The pastas are so so good and the winter veggie salad was stellar too.   There‚Äôs literally a dearth of good food options in shahpur Jat and this cafe is a respite.   The servers are so friendly and service was surprisingly quick.  The coffee and banana cake are worth an order Along with the mains.   Keep gobbling xx
9417,The foof was good the drinks we ordered was good in taste Was here with my friend and I personally find this place good for friends only
18244555,"I have given 2 stars only because of the delivery was on time and food was hot when it reached to me. About the taste concerned, I had a huge disappointment. The food tasted horrible. This was my first order from this place, was impressed by the timely delivery. But when I tasted the food, I was left with no way but lamenting over the money I wasted on these worst quality foods. I ordered Chicken pad thai noodles and chicken schezwan-fried rice combo. The Pad Thai was horribly sour in taste, no idea which recipe they followed, I have never tasted a Pad Thai as this one. Too much sour that I had to through away more than half the amount to gutter. About the Chicken Schezwan, again a disappointment, too high on salt, it disbalanced the taste buds in my tongue. Horrible food. Never going to order from this place again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYBODY.  STATUTORY WARNING:- ORDER IN YOUR OWN RISK."
18244555,"SORRY TO SAY BUT THE FOOD WAS VERY SPICY ACIDIC NEVER GONNA ORDER AGAIN ¬†SOUP WAS ONLY WATER AND SPICY , FISH WAS COVERED WITH SPICES"
18222566,"Amazing Service ! The person was on toes throughout. Very concerned about how the food was placed on table and if everybody could reach up to it. I particularly loved the non poky nature of qualitative crowd. The food served was amazing , fresh totally worth the cost. Since it was a weekend we had to pay a pretty high sum obviously for the entry however I would say it was worth the ambience and hippie dj -Who absolutely stunned me with his mere presence. I was little disappointed with the ready made nachos they served, really hoped that they would be serving Self baked nachos but they didn't. Veg Lasagne is highly recommended !"
18222566,"Recently went to the restaurant to cover the shoot for a party. I liked the look and feel to the restaurant. It has a nice ambience.  The best part is the service. The staff is very polite, cooperative and helpful.  The food is also good. As it was a party, there was buffet. The snacks, including paneer tikka, lahori mushroom and veg seekh kebab in veg were great followed by a nice main course with dal naan, rice and paneer in veg and butter chicken in the non veg menu. The desert included brownie with ice cream which was also pretty delicious.  Overall I would rate the place as -  Look and feel/ambience - 4/5  Service/staff - 5/5  Food - 4/5  Although the only problem I faved was regarding the parking space. So I would suggest metro as a better means to reach here as the green park metro station is around 4-500m from the restaurant."
18222566,"So we had a office party at The Groghead and it was all that should have not happened. Still trying to start with a good note, the staff was courteous. That's all about it. The major turn off was DJ. Even after persistent requests for songs, he was hell bent at making us grove to his choice which could not set the right mood. He kept playing the single song until it was the party anthem.  Our party was spoiled then and there. He paid no heed to any of the request. Also, it was a buffet since it was a office organised party. The snacks were not offered. We had to wait for hours for snacks. Everything served was in lowest of quantity.  Coming to food, I can vouch for Veg Biryani (yes, it exists) and kadai chicken.  Rest, I heard people praising butter chicken and dal makhni too. Choice of music needs major make over. Rest the place can be visited once."
18222566,"STAY AWAY FROM GROGHEAD! Groghead is one of the worst Bar I have ever visited in my life!! The over all experience was horrible and the management's attitude towards my grievances was pathetic and shameful.  The Food is unpalatable and stale and is on par with the food sold by street/road side vendors. My friend and I got food poisoning after eating the unhygienic food at Groghead. The drinks are a joke and are watered down with cheap alcohol and mixed with 80% watered down stale juices or bland gas-less sugary soda. ¬† The service is the worst I have witnessed in my life! Neither are the staff members efficient, nor do they have the basic manners of dealing with a customer. Plus I am sure most of the positive ratings of groghead is Fake and reviewed positively by the owner and his family/friends.¬† Stay Away from this Disastrous Place and save your hard earned money to be spent on something worth it."
18222566,"Visited with friends over cocktails, beer and snacks on a ladies night. The ambience was pretty decent with dim lighting. They had a balcony area for smokers but with limited seating.¬† For drinks we ordered Beer(served chilled) and Mojito was well balanced. For food we had ordered:¬† 1)Poutine with bacon- 4/5, I absolutely loved it! Fries topped with melted cheese yumm!! Ordered twice. 2)Fish and chips with tartare sauce-3/5, taste was average, portion size decent. The vibe was good with great music. Service was on the slower side once the place got crowded. Staff was friendly and courteous."
303723,I don‚Äôt think it is a very good place because its quite dark and its running good because of the location. Pizza and risotto is good capaccino is fine but macchiato sucks not up to the mark at all. Could have done better.
303723,"This place has good shakes and white sauce pasta overall it was okay and it is average in ambience, the staff was taking too long to bring the order and it's quite overpriced place according to the taste. It could be improved in in pizza, and the the price & staff."
303723,"I & my besti went to shahpur jat for shopping, finalized everything and est tym for alteration was about an hr ! So we decided grab something and found cafe red ! We ordered coffee, sandwiches and pizza ! All 3 items were awesome. Cozy environment as it was daam cold outside. Must visit if u r in or around shahpur jat."
18291469,My dog loved the cupcakes that we ordered from their cafe for his birthday! The presentation also was so so cute!! I really look forward to visiting the cafe more often with my baby! I also got this cute bandana for him! They are really good!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
18291469,"I love taking my dogs to puppychino. It‚Äôs a place dedicated to pets and people who love them. It even welcomes people who don‚Äôt have any pets, allowing them to spend some meaningful time with those of others. Puppychino also has the cutest mascots!   Ever since my kids were puppies, Nayani has been yummy making cakes for their birthdays. The caf√© is clean and maintains hygienic conditions for animals and humans. They have hand sanitisers on every table - which goes to show their active concern towards proper sanitation where humans share place with animals, and likewise.   The food is great, and in particular, my partner and I love having shakes here!   I highly recommend puppychino to everyone! :)"
18291469,Amazing place for your puppers! They pay attention to every detail. Their Doggo Menu has a variety of things! My dogs seem to love the Peanut Butter chicken Cake! The Hooman food is amazing too! You need not be a Pet parent to enjoy this place. It'll definitely put a smile on your face!
18291469,One of the best cafes ive visited! Kudos to the owner for coming up with such a great initiative..Food is equally amazing and so are the fur balls‚ù§Ô∏è
18291469,"lovely place with amazing food and ofcourse, company! The initiative is amazing, and the way the cafe is managed- even better!"
773,Order Chic chic peri peri pasta and Chicken meat sauce lasagne pasta from slice of itlay when I find lots of positive review about their pasta. The delivery was quick and the food was perfectly packaged. Would like to try this restaurant again. Highly recommended :)
773,We ordered a veg farm house pizza and a mexican fire roman submarine. The food was delicious and I think it is one of the best among all the food outlets around that area. Will order again to try their salad and pasta menu also.
773,Order penne garden salad and hudson valley calzone.¬†All servings which done under this section is twisted in way that one cannot able to differ that it is Indian or purely Italian. It‚Äôs a recommendation for all please pick something from these sections to try something new.
773,"Seriously speaking seen their outlet many times but never tried their serving because I always prefer pizza of Dominos. In fact, for me Pizza means Dominos. Sudden carving of pizza and Dominos outlet working is suspended took me to them. Firstly, I scanned their menu. Very large menu and also quite impressive. Ordered CHICKEN HEAVY WEIGHT PIZZA which was super tasty."
18282047,"Ambience : A Mexican corner in Khel gaon so colourful & vibrant that fills the visitor with energy. Cuisine : Salsa & Guacamole - Very balanced n yummy served with variations of salsas such as watermelon, tomato, Jalapeno. The serving is sufficient for 3 pax.  White Wine Mushroom - Disappointing as it was very acidic, the whole essence of same was ruined. Potato Agilo Agilo - Very tasty, bit crispy and earthy.  Mexican Chared Morita Chicken Skewers - Soft & tender  Veg Tacos - Nice & Soft. Sour cream was good  Drinks : Must try tequila & margarita... these ones are to die for. True Mexican essence. Virgin Mojito was very refreshing, balanced. They offer complimentary shots too.  Service - Very prompt, good."
18282047,All I have to say is Chargrilled pork and tequila! Made me fall in love with pork and pork fat. One place that makes me dream of pork! Absolutely heavenly with the soft capsicum and the amazing spicy sauce which gives runny nose.   Of course they have other great dishes and generous serving size. Any day for a good hearty meal. But the only sad thing is they are not open round the week. Only on weekends.   Double thumbs up!
18282047,"A long awaited visit wasn‚Äôt disappointing.  Visited Arriba on Saturday evening at khelgaon(now shifted to Mehrauli). We were offered outside seating. The place was classy and aesthetically managed. They had an indoor seating area and coolers outside to beat the heat. Ordered some tequila based cocktails. They got an exhaustive offering of cocktail varieties to choose from. We ordered  1. smoked chicken guacamole, smoked chicken mixed with avocado served with tortilla. 2. Charred Morita chili chicken skewers.  Food wasn‚Äôt disappointing and offerings were generous keeping the quality level in place. Prices are on higher end however you get what you‚Äôre paying for. One of the best options for a romantic date. Will share review of Mehrauli once get a chance to be there."
18282047,"After a long wait for good Mexican food... Arriba quenches that craving with finger-licking food, and tequila cocktails to slurrrp! This place has a good taco, burrito, fajita, quesadilla, tostada or whatever kind Mexican you want to hog on!   Ambience - 3.5 Food - 4 Service - 3 Drinks - 4.5  Head here if you are a fan of Mexican food! It‚Äôs one of the best in the city."
18282047,"Mexican restaurants have usually had a unlucky run in Delhi and i don‚Äôt mean the tex mex type. The cuisine should have an acceptance for our palettes but it seems not. So i wanted to try Arriba before the Mexican curse hits it, although i hope it doesn‚Äôt because this once looks like it will be a regular on my list."
743,"We visited this restaurant on a weekend afternoon. It was buzzing with people. This was our second visit to the place. If you are craving some authentic chinese cuisine, rest assured you've come to the perfect place. We ordered mixed fried rice, chilli chicken dry, chilli manchurian and pancakes. The chilli chicken served here is completely different from what we usually get elsewhere. We loved every bit of it. Quantity is sufficient for 4 people. Visit recommended!"
743,Always been my go to place when it comes to have Chinese or japanese cuisine.. die hard fan of their pork chilli and lamb chilli... love for daitchi forever and ever ‚ù§Ô∏è
743,"This place definitely holds a very very special place in my heart since this used to be my mom‚Äôs ‚ÄôGo to‚Äô place for Golden Fried Prawns and Wanton Soup! Surprisingly the restaurant still smells just the same ‚Äòchineseyy‚Äô as I remember from my childhood. The food quality though was extremely disappointing! Quantity wise it definitely wowed me, but taste, quality, freshness was lacking in my meal here.  Chilly chicken definitely was the biggest bummer with the chicken chunks (mostly breast pieces) being extremely chewy and rubbery. The preparation too was absolutely disappointing with chicken being separate, chilly separate and onion separate yet just lightly tossed in the wok for the dish‚Äôs sake. The golden fried prawns though were decent and the prawn size was definitely satisfying to look at. The batter though wasnt crisp enough and the prawn was overcooked. The tom kha soup definitely saved my meal here. Refreshing and very flavorful! Definitely this place will always be special to me but foodwise, they really need to up their quality delivery game to beat the latest in the market.  Follow my food journey on Instagram at AllThatSheAte!!"
743,"This to me is the best chinese food in India. The pork chilli fry dry and mixed hakka noodles is to die for by themselves, even before you start looking down the rest of their menu. Love their thai soup and their honey chicken too. it‚Äôs reasonable and old world to top it all."
7759,A place providing quality bakery products since many years . All time favourite to have cakes and bakery products for birthdays and family functions. We have ordered this cute fruit cake for our little angels first birthday ‚ù§Ô∏è
7759,I tried blueberry cheese pastry from this place!! It tastes too yummm I just loved it Do try once whenever you visitüëåüëå
311483,"Came here for dinner and had great food and good staff would recommend this place to friends.We had burgers,white sauce pasta and mocktails.Everything is good.Come and try this place."
311483,Food is okay-ish!  Not too gud not too bad The interiors are pretty good. Posters are fun to read.  Overall fine place to hangout with frnds in shahpur jat!
311483,"While walking and waiting for a table at another restaurant and being super hungry, I came across this little cafe and decided to try the food. We ordered the Chicken tandoori momos and to my surprise the momos were delicious. One of the best tandoori momos I've had (being a momos/dimsum lover)   If you are in shahpurjat, and need to have a quick bite, this is the spot for you.  Every time I am craving tandoori momos, I know where to order from.   I recently got back from a vacation from Gods own country where it is normal to be in foodcoma as the food is FANTASTIC, however I was craving for some momos.   Nothing better than fulfilling my craving with some chicken tandoori momos from this place. What I love about these momos is that they are super generous with the chicken filling. .  Le rofl .cafe is situated in shahpurjat. You can also order through @swiggyindia and the food will reach before the expected time."
311483,"I visited this place last week with my family and to my surprise I had a great experience. From outside it was looking like a really small cafe but trust me it is not small at all. Though we had to wait for 10 mins to get the table but the staff was really humble and nice.   We had ordered veg red sauce pasta which was really nice and different and more authentic then what we get in the market.  Veg exotic burger was just full of taste that I can't express in words and that same taste only actually forced me to write a review for the cafe almost after a week.  Overall nice ambience,good music with good good.  Would definitely pay a visit sometime soon."
311483,"A nicely done up cozy space with a huge tv, beers, sheesha and Maggie. Your own living room away from home sort of a place. Loved the coffee, loved the posters all around."
18180080,A very lovely and a neat place in Basant lok market has a very good ambiance and a good crowd .Margherita Pizza and manali aubergine arehave a very subtle taste.Good place will surely recommend
18180080,Really tasty and really fresh.
18421026,"A nice little quiet place ¬†that you can visit with your friends. Ordered Veggies Pizza and Golf Balls as per the owner's recommendation. The pizza was thin and cheesy and nicely made but the golf balls were not upto the mark. They were soggy with excess salt. No ""Mozzarella and jalapeno filling"" as per the menu. However it was nice to see happy staff on their feet at all times. It was a delight to see smiling faces serving you!"
18421026,"Small cafe with well decorated interiors with indoor and outdoor seating area.. Had vargin mojito and paneer tikka pizza, mojito was average but pizza was delicious.."
18421026,"Quaint cafe serving good quality pizzas and coffee. Good place for coffee, conversations and more! The decor is warm and inviting. The prices are attractive and the food is quite homely and flavourful!"
18421026,"The cafe is pretty spacious and has a great ambience. The staff is def and they understand sign language. The food is great but the service time is pretty slow. The pizza is very cheesy but lacks a bit of flavor, could've been better if a better topping was made."
18421026,"I stumbled upon this restaurant on the top floor of a building while roaming around in Shah Pur Jat. It looked interesting, the decor was inviting and the place was empty.¬†  Moreover, the server was deaf and mute but really sweet and friendly and managed to communicate effectively. I was intrigued and decided to get food here.¬†  For drinks, I ordered a mocktail-Passion Fruit and Basil Fizz.¬†  I took my time browsing through the menu given the variety of foods available here-pizzas, pastas, wraps etc.  The drink took ages to arrive. I kept asking the server and he said it was coming. Then I placed my order by writing it down and asked how soon it would be ready as I was in a hurry. He wrote 20 mins. So far so good.  I kept waiting and waiting and after repeated inquiries, I was informed that it would take a little longer. It took AN HOUR!!!¬†  I was furious and went to the lady who was managing the kitchen. She informed me that the staff hadn't arrived that day and she was doing everything herself. In that case, she should have informed me that it would take an hour not 20 mins!  I wanted to give them a chance and had the food packed since I was in a hurry. They didn't even have forks and knives but packed the good for me.¬†  For appetizers, I had ordered potato and cheese croquets. They were excellent and I enjoyed them.  Then I tasted the pizza. It was simply awful. And cold. It was tasteless.  Then I tried the lasagna. It was even more awful. And spoiled. The cream had a sour taste and it smelled funny. Lucky for them I had packed the food otherwise I would have returned it.  Then I tried the paneer wrap and it wasn't all that great either.¬†  I have never tasted such awful food which was also spoiled. I was the only person in the restaurant, yet they took ages to prepare all this.¬†  Considering that this place isn't cheap either, I would avoid this place at all costs. Very very disappointing:("
18322609,The ambiance at the roof top seating was really good and the food was also amazing. Really nice place to visit!
18322609,Good food good ambience!
18322609,"Very nice ambience, music is soothing, food was also delicious, courteous staff. Had a good time!"
313012,good
18332063,Staff is very good frent office and Decorated is very nice.Kit -Ket shaks is very cold .     Cold coffee is extra suger syrup. and very cold . Service is good ..i really like this cafe ....üëç
18332063,"I have been to this place thrice now. The first two times were really good, the third not so much. I love its central location and beautiful decor. It's a good place to spend an evening with friends. Its being vegetarian helps in my liking it more. And you know, there are books. I loved the Thai green curry here. The smoothies are nice too and those tall glasses look good!  Another must try is spinach, walnut, raisin lasagna although I told them to leave raisin out of it. It was so good I almost wanted to order another one! They have delicious hot chocolate as well.  The mint lemonade is very fresh and infused with real mint. The xindalu was pretty disappointing with loads of garlic but no other flavor. Bland and boring, better to steer clear of it.  The rates are very reasonable and the service is alright. I hope to head back for that lasagna another day."
18332063,"Great place , wonderful atmosphere , apt and convenient location, friendly staff! This brownie ice cream dish was the best when it came to trying deserts. This place boasts of a wide variety of pizza's as well as other italian dishes too !"
18332063,"Small cafe in South ex. Pizzas have a very thin base, they can improve on that. Hope the menu gets upgraded as it's pretty simple as of now. Good for a short snack and conversation."
65,Drums of heaven in green park is one of the very rare places in this city which provides authentic food professionally cooked using quality ingredients and they at least provide the dish you order accordingly to how the dish is meant to be made and not some crap made by chefs who have no idea what they are cooking which is the case with 99 percent of the Chinese takeaways in Delhi....special mention to Jaspal Singh their senior who is very helpful in understanding what the customer wants which is again with majority of the rubbish operating in this city
65,Mouthwatering delicacies served by courteous and professional staff. The food is simply delicious and probably the best I have eaten anywhere in the world. The restaurant has a great ambience. Overall a truly memorable experience. Everything was fabulous.
65,The best Pan Asian food in India. Very hygienic restaurant. Excellent service and each dish is a masterpiece. The most delicious food I have ever eaten.
65,"Every time I ate I had stomach ache after meals, but the lobster ü¶û seemed good"
65,"We had the Penang curry, Singaporean noodles, and Hakka chowmein. It was all excellent!"
18216942,"Order 40 min late still said ‚Äúin kitchen‚Äù called 10 times, they hung up on me 5 times in a row telling me to talk to Zomato. Finally got a hold of Deepak who actually takes the call versus hanging up. Says wait 5 min. Call back, says wait 10 min. Order 2 hours late and then they stop taking my calls so canceled the order."
18216942,Worst delivery service it was 2 hrs late and yet they did nothing
18216942,i visited here. i really liked there ambience and food they served food was very very tasty and the that they serve are also very good they serve a good tuna rolls
483,These times are calling for extreme hygiene measures but here we are finding cockroach in a gravy served by a reputed restaurant. This just shows the lack of cleanliness and seriousness in operation on their part. Reflects poorly on the image of Moti Mahal Delux. Moti Mahal MOTI MAHAL DELUX RESTAURANTS
483,"We went here in January this year. Liked the ambiance.  interior was good. staff was courteous. We ordered  VegThai curry, veg steamed rice, paneer lababdar,  Turha nan. With that  We ordered virgin mojito and monster shake. Loved the food  and highly recommend."
483,"Awesome food. Must try the authentic Butter chicken and Mutton barra. Ambience is not so good but if you are a hardcore non vegetarian then you will love this place. Dont see the menu and ask them to serve you all the dishes which are famous there, you will love most of them."
18163906,"Cafe 5H is a really small pretty cafe at Shahpur Jat market. Firstly, we were served with buttery cookies. After that we started hogging with kala khata and chocolate shake with chicken salad , fettuccine pasta and Khow suey. Their Walnut brownie was what I loved the most in deserts.  Food tasted well but can be improved. Service was also quite slow."
18163906,"Nice cozy place.. We had fetush salad, pesto pasta and their signature khow suey... Everything was upto the mark.. Yummy and not very hard on pocket ."
18163906,"Amidst the most underrated area of Delhi i.e Shahpur Jat, there is this cute little quirky place which has this cute ambience and a very small place but enough to get you utterly delighted. The decor, the furniture and the vibe everything is soothing but the food was a major disappointment.   What we ordered :-  1) Paan Pasand (TKC's Favourite)  I am a Paan freak. This is something which I have to have every weekend after dinner to give a great end to the fancy dinner and to have it as a shake was something very different. A phenomenal idea I must say and a good shot at it. But what I thought was that only giving a neon green color and only the flavor of paan was not enough. Had you put some Gulkaand touch, it would have been another level to be honest, But , for the sake of the taste of the paan it was a good attempt.  2) Spicy Banta  It was a superbly refreshing drink. Mixed chat masala within Cola was LIT. The only thing which has good in the entire order was this only. Something which can definitely ordered in case visited. It was superbly chilled and tasted superb. This is something which can definitely be made by self at home.  3) Spaghetti Aglio Olio  The basic definition of Aglio Olio is ""It'is made by lightly sauteeing minced or pressed garlic in olive oil"". Firstly the garlic is minced but what you did put in it was the entire loaf, Secondly, the taste of olive oil is very basic and it's not heavy but the oil in which you tossed the pasta was, is only known by you, Thirdly, the kind of garlic so called bread that you gave seems to be one rotten dry bed which tasted real bad. Disappointment!!! Major Disappointment!! Don't play around with the actual recipes.   4) BBQ Chicken Burger  I was craving for a gourmet burger since a long time and hence I thought of ordering one. When it make it looked so lustrous and hot but then as the quote says appearances are deceiving and this quote is perfect here. I touched the Burger and it wasn't even near to warm. It was the bun base on the bottom then a layer which constituted of lettuce, cucumber, onions and tomatoes., then was the layer of the worst chicken patty being highly dry and cold with no flavor and only a thick bad patty then for the sake of the BBQ name was the barbeque sauce then a layer of smelly cheese topped with the bun. The burger disgusted me. It was so smelly and was very bad. I mean this just below the bare minimum standards."
18163906,"This compact cafe in Shapur jat is simply amazing ! With a few issues here and there , the staff is very polite and helpful . The decor of the place is different and vibrant ! The vibe of this place just gives you this right kinda feel . The drinks are amazing and the food is really tasty !  My order was 4 different dishes  A pizza , a masala egg pao , a chicken dish and a burger ! And all of them were tasty .  The only thing this place can thrive is to look again at their menu once and change few tiny things like a margarita pizza should not have tomatoes .. or maybe to add more soft drinks  But overall I had a great experience and no complains !"
18163906,"A small place in Shahpur Jat market but worth a try.  Food was really nice in a great ambiance. Ordered pizza, which was very well baked and fresh"
192,Listen guys... I've been going to mc d since I was a child.. But I'm sad to say that the quality of out mcaloo tikki has deteriorated over the time... Now it's price is higher.. It has less cheese and smaller tikki... Still a good place to sit with friends and hv a talk... I would reccomend you to go to burger King more
192,"I had ordered, Chicken maharaja Mac burger and fries. The burger fit in my stomach so yummily. The fries were tasteful. The food quality was soo good  The packing made great. There delivery was on time."
192,Ye to roz ka breakfast hai
192,I tried the fries and the mcpuff . Liked the taste. Will visit again.
1675,We ordered chicken tikka roll and chicken seekh kebeb roll in rumalk roti.. the chicken was really fresh and aromatic.. the rolls tasted just right.. it wasn't loaded with too much of unnecessary toppings or sauces. I loved the rolls and would visit again.  Follow at https://instagram.com/dishes_and_destinations?igshid=13zplfd3c6liv
1675,"Accurate Rating: 2.25/5 Strictly Average. I've found the Qureshi's in Alaknanda to be much better than their outlet in South Ex. Ordered Chicken Tawa with Rotis, which was average at best. Certainly nothing to write home about. And the Chicken Tikka Roll was disappointing and way overpriced at the same time! I'd rather order food from their Alaknanda outlet in the future."
313256,I‚Äôve been here twice. I especially went next time for the live music because I totally loved it the first time. Ambience is good with amazing crowd and service.. It‚Äôs a bit expensive and taste is above average. Pasta and pizza was okay but dimsums were a hazard. Drink were above average too.
313256,"Very spacious, the cafe is made up of junk (obviously that's why junkyard) just in case you couldn't guess. I tried the veg pizza, and it was sooooo goooddd.. I love thin crust pizzas and this was the best one I have. The staff was courteous, we had a great time."
313256,I have been this plce so many time and i had a amazing experience.   The ambience is so cool . Staff works like a professional they listen you every time and they are very cooperative.   Food was also delicious and must order are :  Chilly potato Veg platter Non veg platter Dahi kebab
313256,"We went to this place on saturday evening. One of few good themed place to visit. I surely liked the theme of junk. Place was crowded as hell. We took a deal for office party, they provided good sitting space. Starter was good and so as the maincourse and as alcohol picked up it started getting hot. Intercooler is not effective out there. We told them to lower down the temperature and they said its the minimum we can do. Open space to stand and enjoy SUTTA with peg that too winters. Good place to pay visit on weekdays to enjoy the theme and aura of place.  Chilli chicken:4/5 Pizza : 4/5 Spring roll : 4/5 Honey chilli Potato : 4/5 Brownie :4/5"
313256,"I have been to this place 3 times and every time had a different experience. The ambience will make your mood go Ga Ga. The food is good, we generally order pizza and beer.  The staff will listen to you and won't disappoint. The 1st time I went, there was live music too that made our evening like anything. A full on 5 star and a friend couple of mine have their heart in it, all the time you ask them kahan chalein, they say apna to Junkyard hai bas."
18237321,Totally amazing experience. Went there with friends for hang out. Food was also amazing. Sure coming back here again.   Food 4/5 Staff 4/5  Ambiance 3/5
18237321,This place is totally worth to visit. I ordered red sauce pasta which is mouthwatering. I also ordered waffle which is totally amazing. They have such a beautiful interior. The staff is also good. This cafe is worth to visit.

302878,Seriously I don‚Äôt like chicken kolapuri waste of money 4 piece of chicken pakoda üò©
302878,"MY FAVORITE PLACE IN CP. Loved their burgers and Chocolate truffle. It's best out there. We ordered a pizza, burger, chocolate truffle, tea,cappucino coffee, pasta, Ice tea. Loved the ice tea too. It's a pocket friendly cafe."
302878,"Beautiful place with soothing ambience. Tried sandwich, strawberry shake and filter coffee - I must say all were perfect üòç Highly recommended for coffee date üòâ"
302878,"I went to Cha bar some time back, it's simply amazing. I mean what else could you think of when you have a place to eat and read? Nothing right?. It's the best place to eat and read. The food they serve is amazing, the ambience was utterly beautiful"
302878,Amazing place for a book reader and for a person who is foodie . It's a perfect place for soothing ambience ‚ô•Ô∏è
8241,The non veg if this place tastes very good. I loved their mutton seekh kebabs. We also ordered grilled fish and that was yum as well. This place is a mix of a pub and a fine dining place and definitely a mix of both worlds. Had an office party there and it was terrific.
8241,"Always a favourite of mine, where the service is great and the food really enjoyable.¬† I have sampled the chicken makhani, tandoori chicken, sausages and the garlic naan bread is delicious.¬† A great place to hang out early evening, watching the busy outside, while the sun sets.¬† Highly recommend!  P.S. Get your kids to subscribe to my kid-friendly YouTube @CraftyGherkin videos! :-)"
8241,Amazing beer served at just the right temperature. Great service. Music tends to get a bit loud so if you are catching up with a old friend this might not be the place for you. Definitely visiting again for the precision on the beer.
8241,"Went here to catch up with an old buddy over drinks! Ordered my standard loaded nachos and brewed beer. The interiors are nicely done, music was good. We over all had a really nice time. Would recommend a visit with friends."
8241,"Your typical after-work bar, where for a change, the barkeeps know how to mix drinks. An excellent assortment of beverages and a superior and humble staff. Gives you a view of the Gurgaon skyline, while pushing aside the hustle of it."
304262,"This is my favorite spot to have pasta. Their Rico tea is just lovely. They have a star burger called as cafeteria and co Beyonce Burger which is served along with fries, it's the best ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§  I'd rate it 4/5"
304262,"Ricos is the cafe which has expanded it's feet to Kamla Nagar as well. This is one of The Best Cafes north campus has.   The AMBIENCE of this initial outlet is pretty basic and can be compared to any other outlet in the lane. You'll still find comfortable seating place and the lighting is fine as well.   Back to the Business- FOOD!   Chargrilled Pizza was scrumptious! One of the best pizzas out there in the north campus. The base, toppings, pizza sauce and cheese, everything blended so well. 5/5.   Vegetarian Burger Slider- This thing had 3 mini burgers. Aloo patty, Mix veg patty, and mushroom and truffle patty. My pick- mix veg patty. Both the other ones have a scope of improvement.   SERVICE of the cafe is exceptional! Although the servers are very less in numbers but then they're courteous enough to make your day."
304262,It is a fine place to sit with friends. The food isn't great. Even the quantity is less. Service is slow. Not a very goo experience.
304262,Lovely place to go there and enjoy taste food.
304262,"Went here with my friends. We ordered Tiramisu Coffe, German Chocolateshake and Waffle Sundae. The waffle sundae is sinful and a must try. We loved the shake too.  It is just the appropriate place to hang out. Food- 5/5 Ambience- 4.5/5  Service- 4.5/5"
1188,"one of the best place for date, i visited this place with my partner, the food is good and the ambience is very nice. i like this place very much, the staff and service is also good.  Taste‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  Service‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  Ambience ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  Value for money‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"

305525,"Great feel, positive energy and a good family place to create peaceful memories.   You may also click some pictures at a little museum attached to the restaurant."
305525,You can always go to this place for some nice breakfast options and i really really liked the poha.  Happy meal
305525,"This place is very quite and good for a peaceful casual lunch or dinner date. We went there at time of Navratri so they had special navratri snacks which we could enjoy. On peak hours, queue is long and you might have to wait for 1 hour. But in that waiting time you can stroll in handicraft museum, it's entry charges are INR 30 per person.  Lota cafe and Handicraft museum are in the same premises so you don't have to go anywhere else.  Food: 5/5 Ambience: 4/5 Staff: 4/5"
305525,"We visited this place last week on a late Sunday afternoon for lunch as we wanted to see the decor and try the food. We ordered mahableshwar corn pattice. It was just so perfect. Great texture of semolina on the outer crust perfectly shallow fried and not at all oily or soggy and corn, potato paneer and spices as a filling was to die for. We were amazed to try such good Maharashtran cuisine as our starter to share. Then for main course we ordered bhatt ki chukrani, aaloo me gatte, bhang ki chutney. So basically it's a from Uttarakhand region . It was a Dal/curry made from bhatt a type of black beans from Uttarakhand region. It was tasty but more of a neutral taste. But the spicy potato and hemp relish  with the ragi roti red rice and kumoani raita was the best part about the plate. Such good flavour to try from different part of India. In the end my partner asked for masala chai and I asked for Apple jalebi. His tea took almost more than 30 mins to be served but the dessert was there quickly. I'm a pastry chef and to try that was a game changer for me. I loved how the apple jalebi was not so sweet and perfectly fried. The coconut Rabdi was to die for. Thank you for serving such honest and great food. I'll come back home with my mum as well as it's a great experience. Thank you for having us and good luck."
305525,Naveen served us well for evening snacks. Would recommend aam panna special drink
18057792,This restaurant serves  good variety of street food. The quality and taste are both great and I‚Äôve never been disappointed.The service was up-to-mark and so affordable.Best chaat place in the city.
18057792,"Very stale food to eat. Which is being kept for at least 15 -20 days in the refrigerator.Now I will never call home delivery again, maybe next time I have to go to the hospital.How someone is eating rotten food from this restaurant and giving 5 stars. I think either he never asked for food from outside or he must have gone to eat for the first time. Only cheap people and dirty people eat such rotten food and give reviews.And how he got the award, he also bought it. I spit on such a dirty restaurant."
18057792,"Very elaborated menu with reasonable price Built in a train structure gives it very unique ambience. Food here is very delicious speacilly tandoori momos, golgappe and tandoori platter.(5/5) Perfectly cooked dishes with just perfect flavour  Spring rolls (3.5/5) Bharwa gol gappe (4/5) Must visit ‚úåÔ∏è"

307036,My favourite place I like it this cafe You can enjoy a lot with friends inside this caf√© This food is very tasty üòã  #goodmusic #goodfood #goodservice
307036,"I went to excuse me boss with my friends. This is a great place for party and to dance like mad. The ambience was very cool and lighting was the best part. The food was so good and tempting. The quantity was more than enough. The staff was very politeand service was also quick esp. Mr.Kamlesh Yadav. You must try their liquor combos. They were the best. The DJ was great and we danced a lot. All in all a great experience, totally recommended."
307036,"A great place to hangout with friends. Ambience is one of the best thing that i liked about excuse me boss. They have got their own them that is the DARK THEME. I can say the best lighting for party. Staff was very polite. The DJ was awesome. The food was very delicious especially their Dal makhni amd shahi paneer, one should really try those. Totally recommend."
307036,Recently went to this highly lit club in cp named excuse me boss and everything was so good . Their prices are also not so high and main dishes were superly made.  We ordered dal makhni and kadhai paneer with butter naan for mains . And starters were good too. Will recommend you all to visit there if you are looking for an affordable party place. And their drinks are their usp.  I loved the black rose and sex on the beach.must order
307036,"Good place to spend some good time with your friends. The ambience of this place is perfect for a party and the DJ here was amazing. Coming to food we had the chilli cheese toasties, white sauce pasta , honey chilli potatoes and veg pizza. Really liked the cheese toasts and pasta.They even have amazing combo in all alcohol variants. To end the meal we had hot chocolate brownie with vanilla icecream which was just perfect."
18395381,"The ambience out here is so relaxing and soothing.  The food was average and quantity was less than expected. Or you can see I like to see more food in my plate. HaHaHa.. !  Chicken malai tikka :5/5, pasta:4.5/5, Zesty Chat :3/5"
18395381,Ordered pizza and noodles. Both were amazing in taste. Taste was very good and sure coming back here again   Food 4/5  Staff 4/5 Ambiance 5/5
18395381,The food was average and was nothing special in it. The staff‚Äôs behaviour was rude. They served wrong food and the food which was served was too low in quantity. The quality was also not adequate. Seatings were uncomfortable as there were metal seats and moreover the heater was also not working. My overall experience was bad.
18395381,SKy High a good place in Khel Gaon area. Top of the roof and open seating area under the sky. In the night it was so good and some pleasant view.¬† Delicious food and courteous staff and quick service.
18157384,The food was good.snacks were served cold so not so good. Main course was yummy and served hot as well.service is good staff is courteous and polite with patience
18157384,"Visited this place and undoubtedly You Will Be Blown By The Ambience. Because its So Amazing üòçüòç I had visited this place for a 7 Course meal Buffet . Price - is Decent may be 3/5 Taste - 3/5 Location - 3/5 It was a Buffet so No Quantity Check :p Quality -4/5  Overall once for a change nice experience. They had almost everything like dimsums , panner tikka chicken fish and good indian food"
18157384,We had high expectations from this place as we are overly fond of buffets but we were slightly disappointed due to the quality.Ambience is based on jungle theme. Lot of varieties in food and interior are main attraction. The only best part about this restaurant is that they have 8-9 flavours of ice creams Like paan which is the best flavour . In non-veg starter only liked malai tikka little but rest other are not upto the mark.
18157384,"Went to the Jungle Jamboree restaurant on my birthday. The concept is same as Barbecue Nation but what really is unique is that it has a theme. You enter the jungle and find animals greeting you and you also get a bear hug.  So, there is grill on the table and you get all the proteins that you can imagine. A live grill keeps you interested and the tandoori chicken or fish tikka never gets cold. This is non veg heaven! So, once you are done with the army of starters, you can attack on the buffet... It's reasonable for the amount of food you are gulping down. The dessert section is the best. If you want to treat your friends, this restaurant is an excellent choice. Make a reservation before going here! This place gets super crowded."
18157384,"Nice Ambience, I definitely give 5 star rating for ambience. Food was average, I give 3.5 star rating for it. Service was ok - ok, I give 3 star rating for it."
4959,He was a good host and enjoyed the time here .  food was delicious and yummy . nothing can beat the beer
4959,"Downtown is amazing place for the party booze üçª Rishi sharma, a great & polite person. Amazing hospitality.  Also the crowd is really wonderful."
4959,"Mr. Rishi in one word amazing person, service was top notch."
4959,Rishi is very good ...
18429148,"Before covid hit, happened to trap a quick lunch from ever so popular restaurant Papaya. Man, their service is so fast that it wasn‚Äôt even funny! We happened to grab veg Padh Thai with veggie red Curry.    *not giving detailed ratings until this stupid covid19 gets over"
18429148,order this unique Xinjiang lamb for dinner a this beautiful placeüòçüå∂it tasted yum.  the place was beautiful the staff was polite and good service.  must try placeüìç
463,Awesome taste
463,Though it is located in a very crowded space but they have a prompt service. We had the chicken biryani.  It was outstanding.  The proper muslim hand's made biryani. Quantity was easily shared by three of us.  Cleaniness was also maintained.  A must visit.
463,Karims is my favourite place for mughlai food ü•ò. I ordered many thing there but the kababs was the best. The food was extremely delicious. Great ambience and service. Must visit
463,"A great place for Mughlai lovers. They have almost every Mughlai dish on the menu, and you're spoilt for choice. I have tried chicken jahangiri, nithari, keema man and some other dishes. The dishes are top notch, and the service is above average. It is crowded most of the time, so you may have to wait to get seated. Cleanliness and hygiene are reasonable, by old Delhi standards. Use the metro to reach here, don't even think of bringing your car. Crowd is a bit conservative, but I went with my girlfriend, and no one bothers you there. If you want a better ambience, you can try one of their multiple outlets scattered throughout Delhi."
18289242,"Amazing place. I love the vibes of this place so much. Great ambience. Food is awesome, specially pasta n shakes."
18289242,"The place is beautiful.It has these little rooms with a different theme in every one of them .  It also has a large with multiple booths.  Everything except the food about this place is amazing The ambience, the set up, the staff . A1 Food not so much.   We ordered a mezze platter and we would not go to social for that again.It is place I‚Äôd rather suggest to people who are working than college students .   The lighting is dim and the vibe is calming yet lively. Not a lot of college students want that.It‚Äôs a place where you‚Äôd like to drink a beer or two with your colleagues ."
18289242,"One of our favourite party places in Gurgaon. Great music, great vibe, quite centrally located, lovely staff and love their Bantas. All the flavours are pretty amazing. We have also had Khow suey over there and it‚Äôs pretty amazing. We have always had hazy nights over here and that‚Äôs absolutely a cue that we have had a great time out here. Do go there for their different flavoured shots, finger food and their iconic electric LIIT.  For more such reviews, follow us on Instagram and Facebook: twohangrywomen"
18289242,"Food and Amibence was top class  It was very crowded  and then too service was of top class. Mutton biryani - very flavoury, tastes  very good (4.5/5) Awesamosas- very unique dish tastes average ( 3.5/5) Gravy momos and butter  momos - tastes very delicious, very spicy and flavoursome (5/5) Choclate blood bath dessert was also very tasty. So many toppings  and all that choclate was very good (5/5) Presentation was average (3.5/5) Totally worth it"
18289242,"Beyond doubt, the best drinkery in cyber hub. Such great innonative cocktails and food options. Love their jalapeno cheese nads. I tried something called the thai massage too which was super tasty."
799,"Gulati one of the great name for dilecious foods in Pandara road, long time ago I was there with my friends and had meals over there. Kastoori Kebab and handi biryani was amazing taste. must try food at Gulati."
799,"This place is awesome. The quality of food and quantity is bery good. The ambience is good too. I ordered dal makhni, butter chicken and malai kofta with some garlic naans. The food was very delicious. They also have a very friendly staff. üòã"
799,Visited pandora road outlet last month and i personlly considered this place as a north indian and mughlai food in delhi. The food is amazing  I ordered butter chicken and tandoori naan both were too good.  The prices are bit high but worth it
301998,Awesome food... taste of Dahi Kebab was out of this world. Creamy Broccoli & Kurkure shotsü§§ü§§ Everything was just 5* Also the representation of the food fascinating part. Please must visit this place for fine dining. Also famous Veg staters of this place is Achari Chaap Tikka which is also good in taste.
301998,"tried there thali which have paneer tikka , kadai paneer , raita , butter nan , rice , gulab jamun nd shikanji it was very good"
301998,Punjab Grill is amazing in terms of food and has a good ambience overall however I think that they can make it better with their staff being a little more friendly and engaging. It is a restaurant where you pay a good price for the food which I thi k it‚Äôs worth it but should also feel the same in terms of the surroundings. So good place to go if you wanna enjoy fine dining experience and I would rate it 4 because of food - 1 I have taken away because it can be more happening.
301998,All Gud
307113,"I went here on my last exam. Since I'm a KNCite, so it's our favorite spot. We ordered a lasagna and pizza. I just LOVE the INTERIOR. it's mind blowing. It's well maintained. They decorated it well on Christmas and new year. Their Pasta is also a must try ."

18345728,Indian accent is the best restaurant in delhi and i believe must be the best in india too... Wonderful chef s tasting menu... everything was just so so good...
18345728,This place serves each and every item in a unique manner. This small difference makes a restaurant different from other. Keep it up
18345728,"I have visited quiet long time back and posting this review quiet late,they have a la carte options and degustation course,they provided variety of degustation during dinner which they provide starters,main course and desserts which was endless,they have many deconstructed and miniature items for their innovative and creativity."
18345728,"One of the best restaurants, if you want to have modern Indian food, they have some crazy fusion food like jalebi caviar, charcoal bhajia, shakarkandi kebab each and every item on their chef tasting menu tasted great moreover staff is very good and explain each and every dish in detail, ambience was best in Delhi, I hope this restaurant will open soon for public again :)"
18345728,"Masala Library, a place where food is an experience, with beautiful innovative ways to present food that bring out the different tastes of India.  Food (5/5) - I ordered a Chef's tasting menu ( vegetarian) and we had 19 different dishes. The portion sizes might seem small at first but buy the end if the meal, you'll be way too full, just like I was!  I don't remember the names of all the dishes but I do remember the names of my favorite ones which are - Saag with Rajasthani Gatta, Truffle Soup, Tingo Mo Bread with Tricolor Curries, Charcoal Ice cream and the Anar flavoured palate cleanser! All of these were absolutely delicious.  Ambience (5/5) - Soft lights with Soft music was the perfect ambience.  Service (5/5) - The wait staff was very friendly and explained each dish to every person at the table while serving it.  Value for money (5/5) - Definitely, it's value for money and I would recommend everyone to try the Chef's tasting menu.  P.S. - This was my first experience at a Chef's tasting menu and I truly enjoyed it."
18126111,I ordered two things. One was a grilled chicken breast prepared using BBQ sauce. It was absolutely amazing. I just loved it. Apart from this I also ordered a chicken pizza which was also very good
18126111,"I went to cafe Delhi heights Sangam  courtyard  Rk  Puram  new delhi yesterday  with  my family. Ambience of this restaurant  is excellent. Service  and hospitality  was good. Music was amazing. I ordered  food  such  as veg minestrone soup  was mind-blowing, veg Benarsi aloo  platter was out of the blue ,veg pizza  was amazing and veg Hakka  noodles  was not so good .Manager of restaurant  give us complementary dessert because  of  women's day special  and dessert was amazing.

18144458,"Supposedly a highly rated restaurant Ziu was disappointing in fact disastrously so . The good quality was terrible : for example the chicken I the rice noodle salad was smelly , hard , stale and tuinef the salad . The prawns i. The garlic pepper prawns were poor quality , possibly stake , overcooked and rubbery .. just horrible . I will never order from. Ziu . Terribly over priced as well ."
18144458,"Throwback to my dine in days - ziu is definitely a go to place. I chose the fixed menu selection and the food kept coming one after the other. Seafood was fresh and the menu had all their signature dishes.  Must Try -  Appetisers :Crispy Papaya Salad, rice crackers, coconut Creme br√ªl√©e Main Course- massaman Curry, kraprow Gae, Burnt Garlic Fried Rice  Dessert- Homemade Coconut Icecream  !!"
300408,Service is goodüçΩ
300408,"A nice place to eat if you wanna have proper indian meals at good price. Food : 4.5/5 we had chhole bhature, pav bhaji, gol gappe and lassi. Chhole bhature is one of the best in the menu. Pav bhaji was also really good. Pani puri was okayish, i have had better and same with the lassi.   Ambience: 4/5 clean, not so crowded, has 2 floors, very spacious. we took the seat by the window.   Service : it is self service but the orders took time, maybe because of the no. Of people. It seemed understaffed for that big a restaurant.   Prices : reasonable"
300408,Chole bhature from this place is totally love....bhature are so fluffy....Dosa is one of my favourite thing from this place...must try this place...
300408,DON'T ORDER SWEET FROM THIS OUTLET.IT HAS STALE PRODUCTS.MOONG DAL BARFI WAS PATHETIC.
17953911,"I ordered for a chicken bamboo shoot,the delivery was quick however when I opened the box with excitement there was hair inside. It disappointed me because I was expecting a good service.I had to discard the food without having it.I would appreciate if you can get back to me and I want a refund or service recovery."
17953911,What's going on Hornbill.. today I ordered pork with bamboo shoot through zomato. You took the full charge but not a single piece of bamboo shoot in the curry.
17953911,"Tried Naga cuisine for the first time, the ""Smoked Pork Curry"" was awesome! If the location could be a bit better, the joint would do really well!"
307618,"Love the different varieties of pakodas served here. My absolute favorite is pyaz pakoda..its so so good..apart from that baigan,paneer,mirchi,kamal kakdi and gobi are delicious too.The chutney they serve here is so good  There is no seating here so they have put few tables where u can stand and eat  If u love pakodas..try this place out"
307618,This place is famous in sarojani nagar for pakoda. Yes they have huge variety of pakoda in menu and price is also not much high. I have not find any things special.¬† You can try onion pakoda and palak pakoda.
307618,Expensive pakode...sold by the piece. Not big or tasty enough to justify the size. Pakoda are soooo spicy and not to everyone's palate. Only one of them I could have without complaining..paneer pakoda. Big block of paneer inside. Can go back for only this one.
18337779,"Though a bit difficult to locate, but once you do though it's all worth it. - The cafe reminds us of a cosy straight out of K-Drama cafe. - The beverage varieties (specially the mock-tails), are refreshing and are also changed seasonally. - The food is beautifully presented and is delicious. - The parking or more like it's absence, though is one of its downfalls  Pros- Ambience, Food, Beverage Cons- Parking, slow service"
18337779,I've been here for quite a number of times and I'm very happy to say that I've never been disappointed!!!

18396054,"Visited this place innumerable times and again this time the food did not disappoint to me. One of the best food places in delhi, be it veg or non-veg. However the staff this time was not attending us well, we asked them so many times for few things. But at the end if the food is good, you‚Äôll definitely visit again. Keep Hashtaggingüëçüèª"
18396054,"Food was good but took too much time to serve the food, overall experience was not that bad. Non veg was good and delicious...worth waiting."
18396054,"Food as usual is amazing at Rajinder and there kebabs and chicken curry keep calling us again n again. Staff can be more polite. Ambience is average but a very good option for those who don't want to stand and eat downstairs. A must try for the non vegetraians. We ordered their chicken curry, galouti kebabs and tandoori chicken."
18396054,"Cafe hashtag .. lol .. cafe is good, taste is also good but prices are bit high as compared to ambience.. parking is a huge problem because of rajinder ka dhaba.."

9565,"Best place to try authentic Tibetan cuisine.Location is the only drawback it faces, smiling faces in the restaurant. they help you in deciding the dish u want to order for you. None of the food is over priced. It comes in your pocket."
9565,"Have ordered food from this place a few times. The food items that have been ordered were Steamed Pork Momo, Pork Taipo, Pork Thukpa and Pork Shapta. The food is really good and delicious. The quantity is amazing. Absolutely value for money."
9565,"I have been to many places and tried every kind of thukpa. When I came to Delhi I got disappointed when I tried thukpa in MKT, I tried thukpa in every kind of places from low to high standard, but they always managed to disappoint me. After all that I finally tried pork thukpa from flavor of Tibet, and anyone can tell why did I give it a 5 star. It was so tasty, quantity was sufficient for a person, and packaging was OK, it didn't leak from anywhere."
9565,"Ordering online just to get it cancelled by the restaurant. That too not instant but after more than 30 mins. If you are going to cancel, cancel it instantly instead of making ppl wait so long. Nice job. Next time don't include items that are not available, in your online menu ok. PATHETIC !!!!"
9565,"Only if there was a way to give them a lower rating. I placed an order and 30 minutes later these people rejected it. I called them, first their phone was busy and then they turned it off. Poor, poor service. I'm sending across a complaint to the requisite government departments to audit them because I'm sure they don't have proper licenses to run their business."
306535,"One of the Delicious, Crispy yummy amritsari kulchas around south delhi. We ordered Mixed , Paneer , aloo kukchas Served with Chole, and onion mixture super delicious. The place could be a little better in terms of cleaniless but the food compensates it fully. Pocket friendly eatery. Must must try"
306291,Excellent food and services
306291,"Went there and had chicken lollipop, chicken biryani and thaali from Nazeer. Chicken was super soft and yummy. Thaali consist of paneer lababdar, dal makhni, raita,papad, salads and rasgulla. Everything was perfect üëåüèª"

8853,"A great place to grab some really quick south indian meal for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The price you get at this place are really affordable. The place is really fantastic when it comes to taste. The taste and service they provide is really commendable. The food is good which really makes this place a must try in RK puram. Overall experience is really good and I often visit this place and would definitely recommend it. #MustTry #MustVisit #MasalaDosa #Dosa #SouthIndian #TastyFood #Delicious #Yummy #GoodFood #GreatPlace #PlaceToBe #DecentAmbiance"
8853,Must try Parotta Kurma here ...
8853,"The outlet is very shabby , i tried onion masala dosa which turned out to be quite palatable but the sad part was the sambhar and coconut chutney which was served with dosa was not upto the mark . The service was every quick and we got our order in like 5 mins of placing an order . Price is quite high if we compare it with their servings . IT'S a road side outlet , there's a lack of hygiene ."
308544,Overpriced according to the food...we ordered schezwan noodles and Manchurian...it was ok...the place is bit congested. good place to have hygeinic food if you are not willing to have Street food as there is no other good restaurant...
308544,Such a slow and pathetic service despite whole restaurant being empty. Ordered non-veg momos which took more than 35 minutes to arrive. The sauce with momos was a huge disappointment. Never going back.
308544,"I was order noodles with schezwan sauce , It was really nice food and service...... Good job team ..... FOOD -5/5 AMBIANCE-5/5 SPEED OF SERVICE - 5/5 You guys are rock flaming wok ..........."
308544,We visited flaming wok sarojini twice .The staff were very helpful and spent time the menu.all dishes were freshly cooked and delicious .thank u Rahul and your staff........
308544,"Flaming wok is one of those place that promises authentic Chinese food but fails to deliver. Just using authentic ingredients is not enough, most importantly you have to bring out the authentic flavours and taste out of them. On papers d menu seems great with some lovely combos and lot of Chinese dishes, some of them unheard to masses but very few of them really made sense to me. I tried Veg Manchurian combo, Honey chilly Potato and Veg Tolumein soup. Veg Manchurian combo almost tasteless, Manchurian is bit hard n tasted almost like any Chinese van Manchurian. Talumein soup is ok-ok nothing great about it and at last is chilly honey potato it's ok, there is one noteworthy thing that is balance between Honey and Chilly, it's almost perfect. I had lots of misadventures with Honey chilly potato coz lots of time there is way more honey that make it sweeter than it should be.  In the end it comes to what u r paying and what r u getting and u r not getting enough to justify d prices or experience, though staff is very welcoming and committed and service is fine, the overall experience and dishes doesn't really leave any long lasting positive impression. This place is always almost empty. So, if u need a quite place to sit n relax after a hectic shopping den u can try this place other than that I find no other reason to visit.  Food(main course)- 2.0 Appetizers- 2.0 Staff n Service- 3.0 Ambiance- 2.5(nice but very dull)"
9657,"Hi Team,  Zomato shows your restaurant as closed. Should we or shouldn‚Äôt we visit the restaurant?"
9657,Ordered burger fries and coke. MC Donalds is one of the pocket friendly restaurants. Also had pizza puff once it was amazing. Totally loved it as it gives flavour of pizza as well is full of vegetables.
9657,"Chicken Maharaja Mac, the real king of Burgers. Tasty, filling & economical too."
310942,"Awesome continental food! The quantity and quality is top class! I have ordered several times from here, they have never disappointed me and i hope they never will. It's also a very nice place to sit and have food . Great ambiance with a lot of posters of bands especially Beatles. Keep it upüëç"
310942,"I ordered the Crispy Chicken burger along with fries. I was disappointed to find that the chicken was not crispy at all, instead it was all soft and soggy. The fries were good though."
310942,I love their burgers and fries and the fact that its light on the wallet add up to it. This place for me is the only decent non-chinese restaurant inside Safdarjung enclave.
310942,Food is very good. The burgers are tasty I like there quisidilla as well. The place is small and cozy. Service is very good. Portion are generous as well. Like to go this place with my wife and daughters.
310942,Amazing burgers
1859,Tandoori chicken was really tasty and juicy Not at all dry from inside Would love to order again
1859,Tandoori chicken is really awesome
1859,Fiund dead cockroach in kaali mirch chicken. Owners attitude was not at all apologetic. A very dirty place to dine.
307167,Awesome place. Staff is super friendly and the food is always delivered accurately and tasty. I am a regular customer and always chose to order from the model town Subway. The place is kept clean which is always good.

Go there for the music. Go there to encounter some fine sustenance injected with fragrant flavors that impress you. Go there in the event that you adore your wines and some incredible jazz music."
6003,Perfect way to discover assamese cuisine. I'm trying to experience cuisines of the differenr staye bhavans in Delhi and this is my second stop after Andhra bhavan. The place is cute and the staff is nice even if their english isn't that good. We wanted to try the big Thali but that wasn't available so I ordered a non veg thali. The fish curry was very good and also a potatoes dish were very yummy. I ordered 2 other dishes (banana chips and a spinach dish) didn't like them much. It was worth a try.
6003,"Tried their normal non veg thali. An excellent assortment of chicken, fish, dal, rice and sweet dish. Tried pudina drink which went well with the Thali.  A very quite place. It was a relaxing experience. Staff is friendly and helps you to make a good choice. I really liked the ambience of this place. Can't wait to try more from this restaurant! :)"
6003,Amidst diplomatic enclave lies this cozy restaurant that serves one of the best authentic cuisine from the north eastern state of Assam. I had ordered a parampara thali and a non veg assamese thali both had good portion more than enough for two people if not three. The fish cooked in mustard and the duck curry were really delicious. Overall a great place and one must visit this place if they want to try some authentic Assamese food
6003,Great place with good ambience.. We ordered sarso fish and baingan pitaka.pudina drink and payas .fish with mustard gravy was just awesome.. Never tasted like that anywhere else in Delhi..baibgan pitaka was also good and more like chokha in bhojpuri..pudina drink was refreshing..payas is basically rice kheer and it wasn't great..in terms of canteen of bhavans ..this is one more gem.
6003,"Was craving a lot for home cooked Assamese food, so dropped by Jakoi. The Parampara thali is my favourite there. Service was a bit slow though. However, the ambience and the taste overpowered that :D"
309548,Ambience was the best... And outer view was fab. Staff was really good and they deliver good service as well. Food was really tasty and delicious.
309548,One of the best restaurants in India which we tried.We found it on Trip Advisor only.We tried few appetizers and cocktails.Cosmopolitan was absolutely brilliant.Prawn tempura and chicken was nice.Our server Ishan was courteous and knowledgeable.Manager Saurabh made cocktails for us which we repeated also.We enquired about the places to roam around in Delhi which he suggested.Wonderful Experience we had.
309548,"As part of 'Gourmetlicious', organised by Gourmet Passport, we opted for their set menu seven-course meal. In a place which I've had bookmarked for long, that allowed us to do justice to the visit and try out a variety of dishes.  I opted for their Non-Vegetarian Menu, with one minor exchange with the Vegetarian side. As part of this, I was served Amuse Bouche, Roasted Beetroot Salad, Studio Prawn, Chicken Dimsum, Assorted Seafood Soup, Sorbet of the Day,¬† Assorted Mushroom with Sichuan Sauce and their Wasabi Cheesecake.  In a fine dining restaurant, my metric is always whether the food is worth the premium, beyond the normal measure of whether it is appetising or not. It is considering this, that I decided on a 4.  The items which stood out for me were their Sorbet of the Day (a mango one), their Assorted Seafood Soup and their Wasabi Cheesecake. The cheesecake is something very different from what I've ever had before and despite all my misgivings for wasabi, was quite a hit with my tastebuds. The Seafood Soup is something I'd not have opted for on my own but was a very pleasant surprise and resembled the likes of Thai Curry, but better.  The remaining food was nice as well, with the exception of the beetroot salad which I wasn't a big fan of.  The service was nice for the most part of it. The outdoor seating is excellent for a date night and with the red candle and the sound of the fountain, it ticked all the right boxes.  Pritika Malhotra"
309548,Amazing rooftop ambience. Our server Rishi was very courteous and friendly. Enjoyed my time with my family here.
309548,"Tian - asian studio in ITC, Maurya is a place to be to devour on the asian cuisine. Situated on 14th Floor of the Hotel, the place has a very beautiful terrace seating. It was my first visit to Tian.  I recently tried the Sichuan menu curated by Chef Zheng Wei featuring the famous dishes from Sichuan Province in China. They have an option of 5 course menu and 7 course menu comprised of amazing and delectable dishes.   Started off with lichi juice sorbet to cleanse the palate. Steamed chicken Salad, topped up with peanuts and sesame. Maincourse dishes - Assorted veggies & mushroom cooked in Sichuan oil was delicious and enoki mushroom made it exquisite.  Dishes had all the Sichuan ingredients that made me experience the authentic sichuan cuisine.   Five Spiced battered bar - a decadent dessert to end the dinner. Definitely one of the finest dessert at tian.  The beverage menu is quite extensive and they have exhaustive wine collection.  The staff was courteous and polite. Paired up my food with Bellini & cocktails made by their experienced mixologist Mr Soumya. Hats off to him for sharing the stories behind all the cocktails we ordered. It was a wonderful experience at Tian because of good food paired up with cocktail stories."
4917,"This fine dine restaurant in Leela Palace Chankyapuri is legendry place! But somehow limited menu restaurants in 5 starts are more attractive for me than multicuisine for the kind of effort they put to make each dish special..one such dish there is Sindhi Mutton, recipe of a homestlye sindhi family..a must visit place for hospitality, ambience and obviously the food! Its costly affair but try them if you are looking for special ocassions!"
4917,"We had an early dinner at Jamavar, The Leela Palace New Delhi. We were 6 ladies for dinner. I had roasted poppadum, and a simple order of vegetable coconut stew with green peas rice. If you are a coconut lover, then this dish is for you. The stew was well prepared and aromatic. Our dessert was the Gulab Jamun. You will have to try Paan (leaf chewing) on your way out for mouth refreshment and healthy digestion, either you love it or not."
4917,"Great food and very friendly staff, eager to provide a great service. Made the experience a memorable one."
6812,"Authentic place to enjoy the decor and the amazing Japanese cuisine. The staff was professional, hot and respectful. We had pork belly and the scallops that were wrapped in the bacon were on the spot and amazing. The pork belly was thin, melting in the mouth and sauce-I wasn't able to get enough. The bacon was just as perfect on the scallops."
6812,"The staff was nice, warm and friendly. We called for carpaccio from Wagyu hamburger, fish tartar, Himachi, shrimp shake, steak from Ohtoro Wagyu on sizzling plate. True to form each of the dishes were plated flawlessly, the fishes were so fresh, the new ground wasabi was so good and the sauces were so well balanced and elevated the meat forms."
6812,"Megu is the Japanese Speciality Restaurant located in The Leela Palace , New Delhi. Megu was one of the first Michelin Starred Restaurant to open it's door in India ( New York Megu has a Michelin star). Once you enter the beautiful property , is when the experience starts . The courteous hotel staff greeted us and we're willing to walk us down to the Restaurant. Megu is located in the right hand corner of the lobby area , just next to the library bar , giving it a nice secluded feel. It was Saturday night and we had our reservation , which helped us secure our table as after sometime the whole restaurant was packed. The wait staff took us to our table and greeted us wonderfully. The restaurant is divided into multiple sections - a main dining room, Sushi table next to the chef and another dining room. We luckily were given our seat in the Main Dining room , which is the place to be. The ambience is just amazing , dark in the colour tone but with more than enough light . The centre piece of attraction is the giant Buddha Statue Sculpted out of Glass and on top of it a giant Japanese Bell with red on the inside , just makes for a perfect look. We were attended by definitely the best Server or Manager in the place and his name was Pavan. He was just very warm and welcoming . He helped us in ordering and answering all questions we had. Before the menu was given to us we were given Wet Towels to clean our hands . That in itself is a great sign of service and it's very rarely seen in restaurants. We had a glass of Red Wine along with our food which was very nice and was the Fratelli Sette. We ordered 3 starters , 2 Mains and a rice on his recommendation and honestly it was way more than what we could have , so at the end of the Meal we had to pack quite a bit of food. The food served here is Japanese but mostly Modern Japanese. And most of the things we ordered , actually just by our food choice and preference , were the signature dishes of the restaurant. For starters we ordered - Yellowtail Carpaccio , Dragon Sushi Roll and Chicken Yakitori Skewers. The Yellowtail Carpaccio and Dragon Rolls were Signature dishes. The first dish to arrive was the Yellowtail Carpaccio . Carpaccio inherently is an Italian Dish of very Thinly Slices Meat with a sauce or an oil . Japanese cuisine also incorporated this style of food but use japanese sauces and fish instead of meat . We ordered the Yellowtail Carpaccio which came with 7 pieces of Yellowtail , so thinly sliced that it was close to transparent. The Fish was topped with an Onion Jam , Daikon Oroshi Dressing , Crispy Garlic Chips and Mushrooms. Once the dish was placed , Pavan told us that all their Fish comes from the world famous Tsukiji Market of Japan . The dish was excellent , very beautiful and tasty . The fish was light and the Dressing really highlighted the fish very beautifully. The Garlic Chip just gave a great contrast to the light flavour and the mushrooms just added a great delicate mouth feel to the dish. Amazing dish and very well executed. Next dish to come to our table was the Dragon Sushi Roll , Another Signature Dish. They have traditional Nigiris , Sushi and Sushi Rolls . Sushi Rolls generally are 5-6 Pieces , but the Dragon roll is the only sushi roll which comes with 8 pieces . The Sushi comes along with Ginger and Wasabi , but they even brought out a fresh root of Wasabi which Pavan Grated in front of us to serve us Fresh Wasabi. The Fresh Wasabi was amazing , I am a fan of Wasabi but the fresh Wasabi was next level for sure. The Sushi was beautiful . The Dragon Roll consists of Avocado and Tempura Flakes on top , drizzled with Dragon sauce. The Seafood used in the Sushi is - Shrimp , Crab and Eel. The Sushi was stuffed with loads of seafood and the size of each Sushi was great . Flavour no doubt was the best I have had and really the combination of seafood with avocado and Tempura Flakes was great . The Dragon sauce was a bit sweet and spicy at the same time. Highly recommend this Sushi for first time goers as they will love it . Next was the Chicken Yakitori. The serving was 2 Yakitori Skewers with 3 pieces of Juicy and Succulent Char Grilled Chicken with a Teriyaki Glaze on top. The Chicken was grilled to perfection. The Chicken had a bit of skin on it which was just crisp and underneath it lay the Juicy and Succulent chicken . The Teriyaki Glaze was just amazing too , have the Chicken a nice Sweet flavour which really uplifted the Dish to perfection. For Maincourse we ordered - 24 Hour Braised Pork Belly , Charred French Duck Confit (Signature Dish) and a Chicken and Egg fried rice to accompany them . Will start with the Fried Rice , which was great and very unique in itself. The Fried Rice was cooked with Soy Sauce and had a great balance of flavours . Chicken and egg were in abundance and really a very fragrant , flavourful and fullfilling dish which accompanied the other dishes very well. The Braised Pork Belly had 8 pieces of huge pork belly , placed on top of Bok Choy and topped with loads of Kakuni Sauce . The Pork Belly was super Delicious , with the fat just dissolved in mouth . The Pork Meat was also very tender . The Pork also soaked up all the Delicious Kakuni Sauce which was a bit sweet , Spicy and sour all at the same time . The Bok Choy gave a great Crunch and Fresh relief along side the Meaty Pork . A Fantastic dish with a huge portion size. Final dish was the Charred French Confit Duck with Yakiniku Sauce and Barley Risotto . Another huge portion of food , the Duck came with a huge portion of sliced duck , close to 12-15 pieces and a whole duck leg too . The Barley Risotto was on the side and a cup of the Delicious sauce . The Risotto was very nice and subtle taste. The Duck was Cooked to perfection , it was extremely Juicy and tender . The Sauce was the best I had in the whole meal and in sometime too. The Sauce was thick and a but sweet which really went well with the Duck . This was my favourite Main dish for sure and really worth trying . Overall we had an amazing time with a great meal and cost for 2 came 10k , which was absolutely worth it . You are definitely paying for the fresh and high quality food , superb service and classy Ambience , infact bill can be much lower if you don't go for signature dishes and less number of dishes as the food was way more for us . Thanks team Megu and Pavan for the great experience , will be back again soon ."
301102,Gujarat Bhawan Restaurant is located in chanakyapuri.¬† Location is difficult to find because there is not any kind of board outlet of restaurant. This is basically canteen of gujrat bhawan.¬† Interiors is good and ambience was also good. Tried their thali which is worth of money.
301102,This is located in Chanakyapuri.¬† I have visited here many times and liked their food.¬† They have variety of dish in menu but they always served thali only which is quite disappointing because if you are looking for lite food then there is no option.¬† Thali is pocket friendly.
4055,The portion of chhole is so small that it is difficult to have even one bhature with it! I knew this so I ordered extra chhole but they delivered extra bhature instead

851,"After reading about their delicious Chicken biryani, we decided to visit the place for lunch. The places was almost full. The service was fast and the kitchen was so clean. The upper part of the wall is of see through glass and one can be so sure about the hygiene.   We tried: Rasam Papad, Chicken biryani, parota and  gravy and black coffee to end the lunch with.  The chicken biryani was really good, it‚Äôs worth the hype. Also, Rasam was prepared well, a perfect start.  :)"

851,"The anna who sits in the canteen counter took my order for one masala dosa, one idli with sambar and two tea. I came with my kid to taste the authentic taste of tamil nadu. But to my very dismal, the people who came after me were serve first. After, waiting for more than half and hour, I went to the counter again to ask where is my order. The Anna reacted like he was struck with lightning and replied as if he has not seen me sitting with my kid for half and hour in front of his counter. So, disgusting, unprofessional manager I would say. Will never come again in Tamil Nadu House. I left without having breakfast."
851,"Being close to my workplace , I landed here few days back for lunch..The dine-area is usually heavily crowded and sometimes you have to wait for about 15 min for your order being places, still the preparation time is less and food is fresh..I ordered South Indian thali , that had 1 chapati, a lot of rice, aplam , rasam , two curries, sambhar, and karakuzambi along with Dahi and sweet rava kesari..If I talk about taste every thing on thali tasted nice..You can ask for multiple turns of dal and curry but the chapati and rice portion is fixed per thali.."
851,"Before starting the review first thing i wanna tell is, man...yummy sambar is available here. It is the best sambar i had in the entire Delhi, its as perfect as the sambar of Tamilnadu. We have ordere Dosa, Coffee and Payasam. All the dishes were great and satisfied the expectations. Perfect crispy dosa, yummy filter coffee & mind blowing payasam made the day best. Overall it was an epic experience.  Food: 5/5 Service: 4.5/5 Ambiance: 4/5 VFM: 4.5/5"
824,The best momos and spring rolls I ever had. Love to visit this place . You will found a fancy ambiance but the taste and quality is quite impressive.
824,"Its one of the oldest shop serving delicious fast food simce 70's.  Like every other eating joint in yashwant place,this is a quick meal place. We orderer  Chicken steam momos(4/5) Chicekn fried momos(4/5) And 2 chicken sizzlers (5/5)  Momos are the one of juiciest momos in th whole of delhi. Sizzlers was also very good interms of quantity with pineapple fries and chiecken steak in the bottom.üíôüíô"
824,"Yashwant complex is famous for Chinese food with plenty of similar looking outlet. We visited the chimney sizzler.  They have small seating area. We ordered the famous chicken momos. They were absolutely delicious. Plenty of chicken and thin layer of the coating. It was soo Juicy and the chutney was very spicy. Just Loved it. Definitely a must try. Then we ordered drums of heaven which were fried but not coated in Chinese gravy like the usual drums of heaven. It was served along with a spicy gravy. I would say skip this. We even tried their noodles which was really tasty. It was full of flavors and perfectly spiced.  Overall If you're craving for momos, you should definitely try this place. It serves one of the momos available in Delhi."
824,"I went here with a friend. We ordered a chicken sizzler, it took some time and then finally came. The smell coming from sizzler was too good. We tried it, there were boneless pieces of boiled chicken with some sauce which i did'nt like much, but the chicken was too soft and juicy. French fries were also good and tasty. They gave us a bowl of fried rice also which was very tasty with sizzler. Ambience was average but just a little suffocative. According to the price i will say it was worth it. You should try it once. @delhisocial"
2701,This is a very lovely small continental restaurant. They have outfitted a replica Orient Express rail car with extremely comfortable seating. It is elegant but not pretentious. The food was fantastic. The quality of the wait service is superb. They offer 3 and 4-course prix fixe. We opted for a la carte as we‚Äôd been flying all day and didn‚Äôt need a huge meal. Light piano was playing in the adjacent bar area.  The only shame is that we are here only one night and cannot return on this trip. Definitely dine here if you can.
2701,"I am sure No one got murdered on this orient express.  Orient Express is one of the classiest places that Delhi offers. With its awe-inspiring decor and level of detailing from table setting to serving.  I went with my parents and also managed to bump into Rajesh Mehra who had come with his family.  Each dish was exemplary from the previous one. We started with the croissant served with minced puree which honestly speaking I haven't seen as small as these.  Honestly, I would love to write about each dish, but I am going to let the photographs do the talking. (Also most recipes are challenging to pronounce for me. ) We had the soups, lobsters, prawns, pork, rissoto with loads of wine and my personal favourite for the evening the Mexican inspired coffee with Kahlua and tequila in it.  The styling and presentation were just unbelievable. From the way, they served the soup and serving the main course. Everything was top notch.  Also, the music was the icing on the cake. The pianist kept coming to me for special requests, and I kept testing him, and he did a splendid job with a not so often played song or probably his first at the restaurant.  #TheGuyWhoPostsRubbish  #foodsnob"
2701,"I wanted to visit this restaurant for a long time. The concept of a restaurant shaped like the famous Orient Express is something that intrigued me. To say I wasn't disappointed is an understatement. I was overwhelmed by the ambiance of the place.   Built along the lines of the fabulous train made even more famous by the novel by Agatha Christie and consequent movie of the same name, this restaurant is another jewel in the crown of the Taj group.  Attention to detail, unobtrusive service, a choice of delectable wines, a sumptuous array of continental cuisine and live music made it an experience to remember. Best Of Luck!"
815,This is one of the oldest and most popular place! I often visit here  And never ever i came out disappointed. There non veg platter  And butter chicken and my most favourite.
815,"The authentic traditional place where one can enjoy with family or friends. I went their with my family and we order veg food. The staff was very polite they knew what they were serving. The food is fresh , very clean place and menu has every dish you can think of. It's a total package"
815,"Moti Mahal has impressed me alot with their food, clean and hygenic interior and friendly staff providing great food and I loved the quantity of the food too very much. Very impressed by the place and I love to visit it with my family."
815,I basically had their  ‚Ä¢Tandoori aloo ‚Ä¢kasturi kebab  ‚Ä¢Murgh achari tikka I can say that the food was awsome and it was perfectly cooked. Giving this place a 5 star as they Genuinely deserves it
18400770,Amazing place and good quality of food
18400770,"I was there for some event - and trust me they offered well class authentic food. Must try their jalebi rabri and pasta , that was actually mouthwatering and so good in taste.  One more thing which I liked over there is chocolate fudge brownie , it‚Äôll take next several days to forget that brownie taste as it was soo good."
18400770,"Ambience - Good Service - Good Food - Super Yum I went to this place for my moms birthday celebration and I was so happy to visit this place service is superb and food was great, the experience is great. I have sweet tooth love to tried their menu full of yummy sweets."

305296,"This food van in located in embassy area and the surrounding area is good. You would like to sit out in the open there. Sadly the food is below average in taste, prices are quiet steep and the owner of the place tries to be over sweet but actually is over smart n tries to sell his non popular dishes by praising his own preparation. A meal for 2 would cost you around 1000 rupees but you can have a meal in same budget at fujya or sidewok which are located half a km away. Overall a disappointing experience and not at all value for money. Lastly the owner tries to take undue milage of  actor rajesh khanna which i find most irritating."
1898,"Starting with the ambiance it is designed in the cheapest way possible, The welcome drink was not upto the mark. Starters were okayish , the menu has very limited options so in case you are a vegetarian you may skip this place & visit Samavar restaurant which is in the same hotel. Having said that the waiters act like over confident & they serve you food that you haven‚Äôt even ordered. I ordered garlic naan & was served pudina paratha instead. I wanted to have paneer for main course but forced to order Bharwan aaloo by the waiters. Overall with very less variety & costly meals its definitely not a must visit place. And yes the guy who plays Banjo here is simply the Best!"
1898,"Lovely ambience,  All that you need a perfect date to be like. The food tastes yummy. Grilled chicken and stuff is something to crave for.  Went there with a crush and turns out she is a date from then. Wohoo. For more, checkout my Instagram handle : @bless_your_food"
1898,"Used to be a regular once in awhile here; started of A1 fantastic. Still nice, but somehow slight change in quality. Do try their Patthar Kebabs. Usually empty, or with couple of politicians farting around..."
1898,"The Frontier is a great mix of accurately private ambience, soulful music and fantastic food and drinks to ensure a great time.¬† The staff is a complete bliss to have around.¬† Exquisite interiors, an open kitchen, and the whole layout make it an aesthetic treat to say the least! Must have : the black dal Do not miss : the live music"
1898,"The Frontier was an absolute delight to dine at! The food was sumptuous and service on point and warm. The staff ensured our comfort and were considerate to our needs (we dined with an year old toddler). We ordered the tandoori salad, paneer tikka, the special daal and bharwaan aaloo. There was not one thing we complained about. And boy o' boy! The Daal and Bharwaan aaloo were lipsmackingly delicious. We are definitely going back."
1900,"Galawat ke kebab is good here, melt in the mouth mutton starter, nehari mutton is fine too and murg biryani is authentic, service is good however prices are sky high."
1900,"We have a history of incredible food culture in terms of variety, richness, and regional influences. Whenever we think of rich royal food, the Awadhi cuisine, a spectacular symphony of taste and presentations comes first in mind. The taste and aroma of Awadhi food is unbelievable.  Most of the dishes are incredibly rich and creamy, redolent with the fragrance of spices, and are delicately spiced, with cashews and raisins adding an unexpected depth to the taste of the curries.    We also wanted to taste the cuisine of the nawabs and headed for The Oudh located in The Ashok hotel, a fine dining restaurant specializing in the elusive Awadhi cuisine. The moment we entered the restaurant we fell in love with the royal rich decor that boasts of beautiful paintings of Mughal kings and queens, classy furniture, and interiors in red and white theme accompanied by silver urns. The walls are decorated with 'minakari' art and 'jalis' (latticed screens) along with paintings and other marble work.   The restaurant sprawls over a large area across the lush green lawns near the pool, with 2 PDR‚Äôs (private dining rooms) which offer full privacy to host family gatherings and high-profile lunches.   The Oudh, formerly known as Darbar opened in 1995, offers an incomparable Nawaabi experience through an array of exotic dishes created by the bawarchis (chefs) and rakabdars (gourmet cooks). The menu has been crafted keeping in mind the visiting heads of states and dignitaries that the government hosts and food lovers from all over the world and is printed in eight different languages.   Authentic kebas worth trying are Lehsoon Malai Tikka, Zeenat-e-Aab, Jhinga Mehrunnisa, Murgh Surkh Angaar, Nakhas ki Boti, etc. And for mains Nihari Gosht, Murgh Fatimi, and Oudhi Quorma which are paired with breads like Gilafi Kulchas, Sheermal and Warqi Parathas (an Awadhi flaky bread) and various rice preparations like Biryani and Pulao are worth trying.   For vegetarians, Crispy Paneer Roll, Moth Ke Asharfi, Kache Papite Ke Kabab, Lazzez Subz Seekh, Tofe e Noor, Dahi ke Koftey, Gulnar Biryani,  Nishatganj Ki Jhalfarezi, Paneer Hazrat  Mahal, Khiley Phool, and Dal Oudhi, along with Oudh Breads are recommended  Coming to our experience with the food and drinks; we were welcomed with a round of the Noor-e-Chashm mock-tail, a sweet and sour lemon fizz based mock-tail which left me refreshed and waiting for delicacies to be served.   Everything in starters section tasted amazing. I specially loved the Tohfa-e-Noor with exemplary flavours. It was a dish made of cottage cheese sheets stuffed with a slightly sweet khoya fillings and rich nuts and topped with saffron. This incidentally is one of the signature dishes served at Indian PM's state banquets.   The starters left me craving for the main course, even though I wanted to have a repeat of Tohfa-e-Noor. Maybe I‚Äôll come back again just to relish the Paneer dish.   In the mains, I was looking forward to the biryani dish, you see, how can one finish off an Awadhi main-course without some biryani. I tried the veggie biryani, Gulnar Biryani, which was opened right in front of me. Oh man, the explosion of aromas the moment the Dum was broken was exquisite. The rich, royal flavours of Awadh were truly represented in this dish and made me think ‚Äì ‚ÄúThere really exists a Vegetarian Biryani‚Äù.   Desserts are an important part of an Awadhi meal. And here too, aroma plays an important role. The bread pudding Shahi Tukra, Milk dumplings -Khush Zaiqa, Malpua Rabri, Rasmalai, Awadhi style Vermicelli - Muzaffar, Sheer-e-Oudh, Qulifi Falooda are the ones to die for here.  I normally don‚Äôt visit a food joint again, unless I have loved the food. And having relished a sumptuous lunch of Awadhi cuisine just like the way a Nawab would have, I am longing for a revisit to the Oudh and am surely going to be there again soon."
1900,Very attentive and helpful service (but without being intrusive). Absolutely delicious food - really rich flavours. Always a bit quiet so more of a romantic meal than a group outing unless you want the place to yourself. But food makes it worth coming back every time.
1900,I have been to The Oudh atleast ten times and i am still ready to have another meal there. Preparation is rich with dry fruits and cream.   Murgh fatimi is totally smacking along with noor-e-chashma and barfili bahar.   I have also had buffet once which was not so mughlai but good on its own.  Service is good too.  My gastrodar finds it damn good of a place.
1900,This place serves royalty. I had a great time Here with my family. The staff is very courteous and they make sure you have no complaints. Non veg dishes are better than the veg ones. A good place to eat good.
823,"Went here with my friends. We ordered afghani chicken and rumali roti. It took while to come. I dont know from where they were making it and they served eventually. It looked good and smelled good but it was very salty. . The plates were not cleaned properly, neither were the spoons. It looked a bit unhyginic and i personally did'nt liked much"
823,"This place is hardly a restaurant. The hygiene level is questionable at best. The staff looks and behaves shady - hanging around saying strange things to each other. Coming to food, we ordered veg noodles, some chicken momos and mutton seekh rolll. The seekh roll was literally just a seekh with flimsy rumali wrapped around it. The noodles looked ok but smelled and tasted like burnt charcoal. The momos were somewhat ok but when we asked for mayo, they said you gotta pay for it separately, which is a rip off. The only thing value for money was the bottle of mango slice. You have way better places all over delhi with nicer food and lesser prices. Give this one a skip."
2702,"We could not have much since we reached at a time when it was midst if Breakfast and Lunchtime. Hence the only items were ""All Day Meal"" which consist of light South Indian dishes such as Dosa etc. Hence could not have much. Otherwise, the ambiance is very nice.   The staff is very informative. On entering the premises they inform guests of the charges if one is just sitting without any purchases. Charges are Rs. 1000/- for a period of one hour. This makes one not sit ideal or hold meetings only but discuss with an order placed."
2702,"Being a Delhite, its always a delight to visit such classy places and here i came across going with my best of company for having a relaxing time. And this time we chose tea lounge @ THE TAJ... and i still cant get over of this dreamy place... The aura just made me feel soo special and so as the hospitality by the MASTER of The Industry.. take a bow leads for sticking to the ROYALE IN THE WHOLE INDUSTRY. I truly relished my time thr having tea coffee and other snacks. Yummylicious.#sakshicious"
2702,If you want to spend some quality time you should definitely visit this place. The view is superb and the accompaniments served are sumptuous. Staff is definitely courteous.

2587,Best momo production in town by this outlet. No one can ever beat them. Mutton and chicken momo both are delicious
2587,Price is reasonable & quality of food is good
2587,"Food rates have been increased significantly; however, taste has been same as it was 20 years ago. Prices have increased and the place and the overall compound are much cleaner and beautified.  The place is every penny worth. chicken momos are worth drooling. We had chicken steak sizzler , and we didn't even leave the cabbage bowl. It was that yum. You shud at least visit once here for these two dishes.   Can't miss: any kind momos and chicken steak sizzler  Can try: soups. Heard they are a big sell."
2587,"I tried chicken steamed momos and it was awesome experience lil bit costly but tastier.it is near by chanakya mall easy to findout,space is little less but u can easily get table there. Must try if u are momos loverüòà"
2587,I love this place alot they might not be fancy but they serve the best .One should try steam and fried both the momos they are way juicy . Also chicken drumsticks with chicken noodles must.
2745,"I always loved this place, Quite and amazing draught beer ... i used to often visit this place around 10 yr ago and will like to visit very soon.¬† fond memories i have with this place."

7620,Kolkata hot kathi roll outlets located at chitranjan park market no. 1 ......they have so many varieties in food...... And its reasonable too....
7620,"Worst food ever. Ordered honey chilli potato and Rolls, not eatable, worst food. Pls Don‚Äôt waste your money. Not recommended at all. Don‚Äôt know how come Zomato is so casual with them when it comes to customer experience."

7620,This is located in market of Chittaranjan Park.¬† Visited in evening for roll. Had chicken kathi roll and fish fry. Food was good in taste and price is also reasonable.
7620,"We ordered the following with ratings for each:-    Chicken muglai paratha (served with aloo ki sabzi) -3 - its crunchy , its fried and its has lots of chicken mixed with egg"
302936,"I am a regular customer of Ashirbad for last 12 years. Awesome food, cheap and pocket friendly. Must try Fish fry, seekh roll and aloo chop"
302936,Love the fish fry! So affordable and yummy. Definitely a must try. Can't wait to come back for more.
302936,"Best place for fish fry , prawn fry or chicken fry in cr park. Cheap and best , located in market no 3 , 10/10 will come again."
1358,"This Eid was special. I had ordered Vegetable biryani ,shikanjvi and kheer makhmali from Viva Hyderabad. The place serves authentic biryani full of fragrance of garam masalas and kheer is thick and creamy.  I majorly liked the establishment of this place as well as the name. Now one can definitely have biryani in North India ,in New Delhi itself. Hyderabad is not a place where in only one would find one!  The shikanjvi was a treat for this summer season. With the temperature soaring high, this drink of theirs is a big hit! Also, kheer makhmali, was creamy and appetizing!"
1358,I was craving for some delicious biryani. Fortunately this place was open till then. I was ordering for the first time. I ordered their Chicken Biryani along with Kheer as i can't be without a dessert üôà Delivery was on time. I will give +1 for their packaging. Quantity seemed too much for me to finish. The biryani looked so delicious and it's aroma made my mouth watery. I took the first bite and found it to be extremely good. They add some magical flavours to it which is making it irresistible right now as i am typing it and i am craving for it even more. The kheer was good but a little too sweet. it's okay though. Definitely a must.
1358,"My mom took me to shopping near this outlet.  Here had our lunch here after that. Before this i never heard the name of viva hyderabad, which was kinda surprising. I had no expectation from their food after seeing the negative reviews.  As i entered in this place,  i noticed the simplicity of this place which was kinda pleasing. Still wasn't sure about the taste though. As we were not really hungry we just ordered their chicken 65 tikka kebab roll. I was shocked right after i took the first bite. I didn't expect it to be that good. Probably one of the best roll i have tried so far. I am craving for it even more as i am writing this. Will definitely try their biryani next time."
1358,"I am a huge fan of biryanis and i have been ordering their biryani for the past few days because my parents are out of town and i can't cook. üôà Here's what i have realized about this place so far : 1. This place makes food using fresh ingredient. I happen to realize that everytime i eat their food. 2. Korma is the most underrated item in the menu. Maybe it's not the best but definitely it's good and is worth trying. 3. After trying probably every biryani from their menju, i will conclude chicken biryani as a winner. it's simply the best.  But would like it if the management can lower the prices a little bit. Leaves a hole in your pocket if you are ordering everyday from here. üôà"
1358,"I am a regular customer of Viva Hyderabad. This is my review for this outlet. The appearance of this outlet and the decor may not look very stylish but it is decent and peaceful. Also, the pricing might seem high at the first glance but once you try their food it will seem totally justified. This place takes utmost care of it's customers by using fresh ingredients while preparing their meal. You can tell that after trying their food. Coming to menu, which does not offer many options. But it shouldn't be a problem as the items which are offered are really delicious. Best thing in their menu? Obviously their Chicken Biryani. They can't go wrong with it. What can be improved? I think their starters can be improved a little bit. Rest everything is perfect. No complaints.  Service: 5/5 Food: 4.5/ Ambiance: 5/5"
3632,"Food was very poor, i have order tandoori chicken, which was almost burnt. Very pathetic taste also the murg chicken was bad in taste.not recommended"

300984,"Loved the chinese platter, the presentation and the variety it had."
300984,I went here last to last Saturday I guess or so. I tried their chicken Chinese chaat which was just amazing and their very famous mughlai Parantha chicken one which was also nice. It was stuffed with great amount of chicken and it was just for 160 bucks.
300984,"Because of the recommendation I tried this place. As I went there at 5:20 the stall wasn‚Äôt ready I waited for 1/2 n hr then I got the platter. Loved the noodles and chilli potatoes. Other than these two platter was not worth it Totally not worth it, the amount they charge for a veg platter is not what is expected. Panner , soyachap and manchurian had no taste honestly."
300984,"Wanted to visit here from a really long time and finally got a chance! It is an absolute delight to see the tempting layout of these extremely delicious Desi Chinese delicacies. The taste was on point, could have been a little more spicy and tangy! All in all, amazing. Note: This place has no sitting. Taste: 4/5"
300984,"The very famous CHINESE PLATTER from CR Park. So many things in 1 plate is such an amazing thing for foodie. It tasted quite well. We reached there at around 4pm, so we have to wait for it. So if you are planning to have this delicious platter, go by 5pm or after 5. Also they had many more things apart from the platter like mughlai Parantha, rolls.. you can also give a try to that also."
311637,"Its a small corner adda for variety of teas and coffee , thronged by ppl from all walks of life , Raju dada ki chai certainly has come a long way from dat tiny little table to this . My bestie and i would head here many a times for tea and Davidoff coffee which he makes amazing . Great going dada , all the best"
311637,It's a no fuss place with very basic seating arrangement...one can have a sip of tea/coffee while listening to songs ...sort of the kinda seating one finds in the towns of West Bengal... situated just opposite to CR PARK market1....one will get lot of variants of tea and coffee and some nibbles as well....I have tried the regular tea once(tasted ok)and a masala lemon tea(too much masala....not recommended)the other time.....can get down to have your daily dose of cuppa of caffeine with friend just for the ambience...
311637,"As the name suggests, singing tree, it is just beneath the tree, which is well decorated and where music plays.it's a place to hang out for short duration, if you are in mood of having chai-coffee with friends. It's just an advanced version of any other raddi wala with a decent decor and stuff. I had coffee, which was just okay, nothing to be bragged about. Felt like, may be the place is a bit over hyped. No snacks are available apart from bun maska and those biscuits, which they call cookies, for no reason."
311637,"An interesting tapri, variety as per the menu is great but the first two teas I ordered weren‚Äôt available. Prices are slightly on the higher side for the place.  Maska Bun is quite nice. It has a board saying no smoking but it itself has a lighter hanging from a tree perhaps."
311637,"Soo.. good. People for whom chai is life, this should be a must visit place in your list. Chai is good but I think it's a littleover priced. Raju da has made a simple tree to an amazing structure which really feels like that it's singing."
1712,"When I order a grilled chicken breast I expect a grilled chicken breast and not cut up pieces of boneless chicken, kindly provide the item you are selling or else I can order boneless chicken pieces from somewhere else which might taste better with some seasoning."
1712,What a splendid delete it was to have food from here loved it so much it was truly amazing I would definitely recommend this outlets as the food was really yummy and tasty to have we loved the Kolkata biryani and also the Chicken salami from here so fresh and so amazing a true delight it was  Also also the preparation of the food was really amazing I must say that I really enjoy my meal
1712,My brother was visiting me so we ordered up some food from here and I must say I really love the presentation and also the preparation of the food and the service was also really nice so amazing and such a delight the butter chicken store my heart and also the Dal makhani paid up we really beautifully with it hands down a really delightful experience it was
1712,Murgh Amritsari and Laal mass were hell tasty and I really loved how perfectly it was cooked. The overall experience with this place was pretty nice since food was worth the amount . These are some unique dishes which I wanted to taste and the experience was worth taking risk.
1712,Stale food
18175256,One of the best place to eat chaap especially their tandoori stuffed chaap and Malai chaap and aachari chaap highly recommended
18175256,No Malai in Malai Chaap . Full of oil. Very bland taste.  No Malai in the Malai Chaap. Only oil. Bland taste.
7613,Not good.. Taste is very poor.. I have expected that gulab jam will be hot n i can re call my kolkata days.. But very disappointed.. Quality can be more better..
7613,I have heard alot and wanted to order from here but it often remains closed for orderingüòï hope soon I will get the opportunity to order online from here
7613,"SWEET IS NOT UP TO THE MARK, BEING A BENGALI SWEET IT SHOULD BE TRADITIONAL AND WELL PREPARED...only delivery was good nothing else, kindly r"
7613,"Another sweet shop in CR park selling authentic Bengali sweets,had a cup of misti dohi served in typical kolkata stlyle,in earthen pot,yummy."
7613,"Barring their Ice Cream Sandesh, nothing they offer is even decent. Hygeine is an issue as one can see flies and ants on their sweets. Most of the items they sell are not fresh at all."
309756,Ordered a dum biryani. It was tasteless seemed more like orange rice with lemon flavour  It seemed more like Kolkata biryani. It I expected a dum biryani and I was pretty disappointed with what I got. Cudnt finish it.without adding extra flavoring.
309756,"I ordered chicken kasa,sarso rui, rice and tawa roti. It was delicious, the roti was like home made. Food reminded me of kolkata. Fresh food, lovely ambience good place for ""pet poojo"". Totally loved it. Last but not the list people were nice. Will always remember the boy who served us food for his lovely smile and kind heartedness."
309756,Have ordered on a couple of occasions and the food I got was amazing at an unbelievable price went for the special combo and was not disappointed at all well worth the price for frequent orders this is the place
309756,So I ordered this chicken tikka achari from khatey raho !  And I must say I loved the taste of chicken tikka achari ‚ù§Ô∏è Packed nicely  Delivery on time  Quality n quantity - 10/10 üôÇ
309756,"Tandoori Chicken is simply awesome.. Juicy, tender n just the right amount of spice to perk up the palate......................... Too good.. :)"
18354627,Got food delivered from here. Was delivered hot and fresh and to my expectation- before time too. Ordered for hyderabadi chicken biryani for my family. Quite aromatic and tasty.
18354627,"Best chicken I ever had eat...its very yummy and tasty..... Paneer makhani quality is also good and very tasty ....try to keep maintain with this quality and taste........gud luck"

18354627,Very very tasty food...ordered the chicken kadhai and daal  saag...yummy...very much recommended...took the committed half n hr to deliver...so service is very satisfactory
18355107,"It's a decent place to have a frankie / burger. I have had their egg cheese roll, schezwan paneer roll, chicken roll, cheese roll and veg supreme burger. They also have momos and hot dogs. Im yet to try those."
18355107,The most pathetic roll I have ever had. There's no professionalism. They have just opened the outlet to show off. They are serving all stale food. Poor service. A big 0 to this outlet.
18355107,"Worst roll and fries I've ever eaten. Feel pukish after having 2 bites. Couldn't even finish what we ordered. Too much oil, no freshness, partially cooked, incomplete order. NEVER EVER ORDERING FROM HERE AGAIN.  no option to give zero rating so im forced to give 1. These guys are food enemies."
18355107,Was in a mood to have a Frankie from here today for old times sake which I regret now. Its been more than 1.5 hours and I still have not got my order for something which does not take more than 15 mins to make. The restaurant does not know where the delivery boy is and when I finally located the delivery boy he said he was just leaving the restaurant and claimed to have a puncture. Best avoid.
18355107,Very bad experience and worst food i got in my order need to improvised themselves on every aspects their staff and food quality everything was disappointing
7623,"Bad!! since its in same locality, ordered directly to the food joint telephonically. Ordered 2 mutton moghlai parathas, 1 chicken cutlet, 1 mutton cutlet and 1 plate luchi cholar dal. The delivery came after an hr after giving 1 reminder call. There was only 1 paratha. Called again. The response was sorry madam, my mistake , I had noted wrong. The second delivery comes with additional rs 20/- delivery charge. Called again, for your fault why should customer pay the delivery charge twice?. Grumbling, no mam please at least pay Rs 10/-. Ok. Was so hungry did not haggled much. Paid. Oh my god: the much disaster was waiting. In my 1st bite, whats this, its chicken paratha. And think my husband do not eat chicken at all. Think of the agony. No one ate that. Next day it was given to our maid, she feasted. My hubby starved . Managed with luchi cholar dal. The cutlets tasted horrible. I was tiered of calling them again. They overcharged. Chicken mughlai is 130/- and mutton mughlai is 140/-. The charged for mutton and on top charged delivery cost. Most disgusting experience. Not worth home delivery. No recommendations at all."
7623,It is one of the worst restaurant to order from as the delivery is always late. The owner never takes responsibility of delivering food on time. If u order be assured to order two to three hours before time coz the owner will make a fool of urhunger..
7623,My favourite stall to have mutton and fish kathi rolls from. Gopal da just makes the best fish kathi roll in town. I also like his chicken cutlet and fish finger.  Tip: pls eat the rolls with kashundi to enhance the flavor and give you the best taste possible.
7623,"I have been to this place a multitude of times - have really lost count. It's a quaint old place with no seating arrangement and sans any fun or frills. You amble along, scoop your rolls and run! Yes sir, that's what the place is all about.  I don't go for anything else but their regular mutton roll. Arguably one of the best rolls in town. I had even struck up a friendship with Gopal and at one point in time between 2010-2011, he would even dish out customised rolls for me, knowing my palatability.¬†  Another thing to try out is his kasha mangso - a real mouth licking stuff!  A must visit. [on a slightly different note: the puchchkawala adjacent to him makes really wondeful phuchkas out of bisleri water and alu kabli. Go for it, guys!"
7623,"Not so good was my first impression for the shop.Located with other food stalls in the CR market,the food joint doesnot stand out.It is a takeaway and not a place to sit and enjoy with the blissful ambience.  The location is very chaotic and parking your vehicle would be a much of task.We ordered chicken roll and the chicken was endlessly chewy.It was hard too.It is very reasonable but yes not worth visiting again."
18239781,happy
18239781,Brilliant paani Puris.
18239781,I just love their sweets!! Their kheer Kadam is very nice and fresh and soft. It melts in mouth. The Mishti dahi is also awesome
18239781,We went to the canteen run by Aristrocrat company at the Kali Bari premises for lunch today. The veg thali has shrunk to just a dal and sabzi. Earlier you used to be giving 2 sabzis and a dal in the veg thali. On top of that we were served a cholar dal to begin with which became musur dal on the second helping. The fish thali had a shorshe preparation which was watery and bad. The piece served was that of the tail portion. This was when we paid seperately for 2 fried fishes at the same price as the jhol. Compare your veg thali to the one they serve at Ma Tara and you will realise that you are not delivering value for money. The canteen had gone down one time and when you took it over it was a pleasant surprise but your quality has really deteriorated over the last few months. I was really saddened by my rank bad experience.

7602,A very traditional place with various choice of cutlets and their famous Murtabak Style ‚ÄúMughlai Paratha‚Äù is super crunchy and heavy and chicken & mutton cutlets are really amazing and should be ordered! And pocket friendly place !
7602,The fry item price is little higher compared to market 3 shop. Any this is one shop visibly available in market 1. They is no enough seating space.  But still outside seats are available.
7602,"A good place to have awesome pakode, we have gone many times specially in the mansoon season a good smell of dirt and mesmerising smell of pakode!!    We have tried fish pakode with mint green chutney and onions and some smoking stuffs to make your evenings more delightful!! üòä"
7602,Delhi rains- smell of wet dirt - a bong all he wants is some pakoda and chai .. Well this place helps me get some awesome pakodas wen i need it.. May be when you see it wont look very hygoenic but i have neva been sick by eating their food for almost 6 years on a regular basis.
7602,"All time stop for me.Always have egg rolls here.Cool place to chill out as its near to the singing tree.Usually we get some smoking üö¨ stuff(cigarettes üòã) and pan and chill out ."
18175328,"place is not look like a restaurant. service is very slow also not enough staff to attend the guests even. staff behaviour is also not good, not even a good response to the customers. I will never visit this place again. return back without having food. after 50 min wait they informed that food we ordered can't be served."
18175328,The claim to be a Kashmiri restaurant rests solely on the strength of the name and 6 items from Kashmiri cuisine in a menu card of over a hundred items. Reeks of marketing ambition over reality. The place itself was more like a banquet hall than a restaurant. The great empty spaces were disconcerting especially with some chaps obviously the owners or owners‚Äô relatives hanging around the sofas next to the billing counter.  To be fair the food both from the Wazwaan section and the rest was excellent. The service from a one-man service team was excellent again. They had an interesting version of the Lemon rice. The chef had a flair and an eye for cooking meats just right.  Another plus was that the place including the washrooms was squeaky clean. It might be a good idea if they expanded the Wazwaan section of the menu from the sub 5%. With the rest of the infrastructure so above average this might well be the differentiator that will propel Wazwaan from good to great
18175328,"So it was birthday party celebration of colleague's daughter. We sat in basement area. Place is spacious, clean and hygienic. The menu had seekh kebabs, chicken tikka, paneer tikka and veg kebabs. Waiters were serving them on seats and they had cold drinks and fruit juices too as it was kid's birthday. I absolutely loved the starters. Personally seekh kebabs should not melt in mouth. One should be able  to feel the coarse texture and savour them. They were like that only. They also had some pakodas. But seekh and chicken tikka were too good to leave. Then moving on main course they had chicken curry, mutton roghan josh with plain and butter naan and also had chicken biryani. In Veg menu they had daal makhni, shahi paneer and veg biryani. I became fan of their roghan josh and birryani. In dessert there was gajar ka halwa which i did not taste but i tried firni. It was so fresh and aromatic it reminded me of home when mom used to freshly prepare and freeze it in fridge and used to serve in mitti kulhads. It had hint of kesar in it and was slightly yellowish in colour. I absolutely loved the food and service. They have big halls and place is at situated with calm surroundings and have parking area of their own. One can easily arrange any party here. I was too busy eating i could not click many pictures."
18175328,"On a Tuesday evening, this makes us the only couple hunting for Kashmiri food, I guess.. when we reached Wazwaan we were the only ones here. I heard about this restaurant from a Kashmiri furniture seller 2 years ago in Srinagar. Inspite of this place being this close to my home, we finally decided  to check it out!   To be honest, a best bet to a place that refers to Kashmiri ...Best to stick to Kashmiri food. But we experimented by ordering Yakni, Gustaba, and some signature  north indian food such as Kadai Chicken with some yummy paratha.   Getting to taste an authentic kashmiri cuisine was great, the blends and the masalas teamed up with rice, were so flavorful took me back to Kashmir...Hope to come back here whenever I miss Kashmir  Probably needs improvement on service to a large extent."
18175328,I love kashmiri waazwaan..and I want perfect taste of waazwaan.. I went there and I found the taste which I want.. Perfect taste of waazwaan.. The ambience is very nice and the hygiene level Is good.. If you are searching and big fan of waazwaan so must go there..
18429374,God aroma nice place me and my friends visited overall 100/100 the syaff is also very kind andbhave proper knowledge of there restaurant nice place
18429374,"Tried there mutton seekh kebab in butter naan roll,right amount of everything better than most of the other places nearby a must try for everyone..!!"
18429374,First they accept the order and then after quite some time tell you that they do not have the ingredients..why accept the order in the first place then? Very disappointed with their service..
18429374,Delivery process is really very bad . Try to choose other than this .i am unsatisfied with this restaurant .and the delivery process . Very very bad.
18429374,very bad service
18459885,had ordered chicken sausage white sauce pasta. it is one of the best pastas I have had in kalkaji in a long time. food was delivered hot
18459885,"My first order from this place. Ordered sweet chilly wings. It was very tasty and quantity was enough for one person. But found a small hair in my food. So that was a spoiler. Apart from that taste is good , rates are very reasonable. But they need to work on their hygiene."
18459885,"Seems like a well-intentioned, cheap eats place but the creamy chicken wings were the chalkiest, most disgusting form of wings I've ever eaten. The Alfredo-sauce stand-in that covered the chicken was especially revolting with an undercooked roux. And the chicken tacos were a glorious prank with itsy-bitsy dry pieces of chicken, shredded lettuce cupped in a papad. Do not recommend."
18459885,"The the food is amazing. Tried their lip smacking Mac and cheese Pasta. The crispy chicken Burrito is insane, a must try. Oreo shake is heavenly. A definite 5/5 for me."
304735,"Garlic bread is always my favourite , In this bakery we have a good experience it is a perfect place to hangout with friends. Price is also reasonable must go and try snacks and variety of cakes. Must try garlic bread and pasta which was awesome in taste"
304735,"I ordered the ""ultimate omelette"" and the ""special waffle"", both listed under vegetarian filter. However, both items turned out to contain chicken sauage and salami. I am attempting to sort out the issue with the restaurant and Zomato, but neither zomato nor the restaurant is addressing the issue. They keep blaming each other and taking zero action. quite a horrible experience, recommend neither the restaurant nor zomato ordering."
304735,"I came all the way to Defence Colony to order a fondent cake from Defence bakery, unfortunately they weren‚Äôt willing to do fondent with fresh fruit flavour. As a resulted I ended up at Raro. Ordered one fresh fruit cake sharing the exact images to avoid any last minute surprise. Tasted a pastry as well and it was amazing. Explained the chef myself over the phone after sharing the two images. One of the guys working here gave me his number and assured that he will ping me the images as soon as the cake arrives. Pick up time around 11am (gave then 2 days to bake my cake). As expected images were never received till 11:30am so I called them and they finally whatsapped the images. Needless to say, cake was missing pieces. So on the top of the cake there were only two items to be placed and not 20 but they missed one from that too. Cake had a logo and they changed the colour of that logo. So dark red becomes light red or orange or maroonish, ok I understand can happen. But how come you change red into a white and say minor difference sir.   Well when shared they said they will gonna make another cake now, unfortunately I didn‚Äôt had more than 2 hours and they again promised that cake will be ready. So I came after driving over 20-25kms to collect my cake and as expected it wasn‚Äôt ready. However they said delivery guy has already left with cake (from chatter pur to Defence Colony 30-40 mins max), after 15 mins called me again to get it delivered at the venue, I refused as I bloody don‚Äôt know how the cake looks like now. So this time they made me wait over an hour for a cake which should have been baked correctly at the first place. Utterly ridiculous and worst part, they kept on lying about where it is and how much time it would take. NEVER COMING BACK here again, EVER!!   The final cake was pretty ordinary and just spoiled the mood and party both. If you can‚Äôt do it have the balls to say no rather than causing problems to others. Also please have some solid cardboard boxes for a cakes beyond one kg else it would be all damaged before reaching the venue"
310816,"Yummmmmm.....Cheese Sandwich Samosa is my favourite thing here. Give it a try, it is worthy of a full blown obsession. Can‚Äôt wait for the lockdown to lift so I get to go out have them again!"
310816,"I get weak at knees at the sight of pizza that the NYC  Pizza offers....it is a feast for my eyes to behold. With such a wide range of options, naming just one favourite is next to impossible!!!"
310816,"The location of the outlet is great, but the place is small. The pizzas are satisfactory. But they make sure the food is content and tasty and they are delivering even today, you can check this place out!"
310816,This is a perfect stop for pizzas. I just love this place and it‚Äôs food quality and quantity. The staff is helpful and courteous.
3039,"The evergreen Nizam's known for its famous Kathi Rolls... The stuff is really good in terms of quality and freshness and is amazingly tasty.... It does offer many more things than just rolls to be fair .... The Biryani is awesome too .... The place is nicely done for a casual Dineout .... Although the prices have been increased over the years considerably but that hasn't had an impact on its sales , atleast it appear likewise ... It is a brand in itself and has a presence all ove the city...."
3039,So I‚Äôve been to this place thrice & i kinda like there food. There chicken rolls are must try.
2437,Ordered food and its even bad than local food shop  Never tasted a pasta like they had. Ewwww
2437,Probably one of the best Italian restaurants here in NCR.  Unforgettable Spaghetti and Bruschetta here.
2437,"This place is heaven for Italian cuisine I tried Grilled Charmula Salmon , Fillet FishLassagne Spinach and Mushroom ,Grilled Chicken and Parmesan Salad , If you want Italian food healthy and fresh food then go and check it out My experience is good Taste wise or pocket wise this place is good  RATE4/5"
2437,Talking about the place 28 Capri itlay. It's one of the best places where I had pizza . Food here is awesome also those you love Italian food must try it once...
18161723,"What I like? The location, parking assistance, ambiance, choice of music that's there but not loud enough to drown your conversations, the special cocktails and the placement of tables that give individual privacy and an impression of space. The food is decent. We ordered Malabar parantha with coastal pink pepper mutton fry, Kerala fried chicken, Ek Bar's tandoori chicken, and bacon and Egg Hopper. The parantha and mutton were good. The Egg Hopper had a strip of bacon on it that was an unnecessary mismatch. The bacon did not go with either the hopper or the accompanying gravy and I've had better hoppers in Sri Lanka.¬† So, will I return? Yes, doosri bar for their Beeda tonic and the Jadugar-ita."
18161723,"Ek Bar is the first and quite revolutionary cocktail bars in Delhi. The eclectic bar has just been updated recently with Chef Ruchira Hoon taking the charge. Smooth craft cocktails, paired with bar bites, inspired by Indian techniques and ingredients. Propped on the first floor in Defence Colony, the cosy bar is full of quirks. Upside down trumpets, spunky bright walls and Indian motif patterns."
18161723,"This place serves a very innovative variety of food. I tried the falafel platter and dahi kabab, both of them tasted great and had an amazing presentation. The ambiance of the place was also superb!üëåüèªüëçüèª"
18161723,Went to this place to chill with friends. The ambience was quite soothing and the cocktails were pretty amazing. The presentation of the food was nice however the the quantity of the food was insanely less for the price charged. Would recommend the place for its cocktails.
18232097,I followed the location available through the Zomato app but this cafe was not there. I tried calling on their number as well but 1 number was a wrong number and nobody picked up on the other number.
18232097,"This is a kind of a place which will take care of everything for you. Any kind of special needs, any kind of requirements are taken care of.  Some of my favorite picks would be the platters, the classical salads, Ceaser being my most favorite.  I also like the fruit smoothies they make. I like the innovation in all their drinks with the naturalness coming fresh."
18232097,"Good place for healthy food. But food is not very tasty, I guess because it‚Äôs healthy. This place is good for ordering as sit out is very small and cramped. Recommend you order home. Can try burger and pesto dish which is what I had tried."
18232097,I happened to visit this place on recommendation. I found myself trying some really unique concepts and unconventional recipes. Based on my experience I would go on to rate the food that they offered.  Grilled Chicken Wrap It's filling and really oil free. Nicely spicy and is stuffed with greens along with fresh chicken  Fresh Grilled Chicken Burger The Burger was a little dry but still the patty is good if it is a little more flavorful. Otherwise it's decent.  Stuffed Chicken Breast with Mushroom Bell Pepper Sauce This one is predominantly green and has a fresh aroma to it. The breast is nicely stuffed with vegetables and completes with some flavorsome rice to go with it.
18232097,"I visited this place with my family . This place is very good. We ordered spice tossed cottage cheese and veggia sandwich , nacchos nibbler platter , low cal mosses of the day , decaffinated coffee . Food was really healthy I loved it . I would love visit place again"
18350143,Nice place and good ambience. Food is also good and staff is polite and helpful. Njoyed with family. Great place to visit. Order chicken tikka very nice.
18350143,This is good place to have good food. Need booking before visiting place in weekend's.Go and enjoy the food with lots of pickle and well behaved service guys.
18350143,"Definitely among the best North Indian restaurants in Delhi. Their choice of pickles is the stand out aspect. Wonderful ambience as well, staff pretty courteous too."
18350143,Brilliant Food with Amazing Ambience. Couldn't have asked for a better place to visit on a weekend. A must visit for everyone. 5 starts from my sidr
18350143,Great place to hangout with friends and family . The  food at this place is just awesome and the staff is very cooperative. The ambience of this place is just best in town it gives a royal experience while eating at this place . I personally recommend you to visit this place .
3492,Taste was upto mark. U can go with ur friends restaurant was pocket friendly
3492,"Probably the best shawarma in the whole of delhi. You can sit, stand or drive through with your order. The shawarma is soft, fresh and succulent. Apart from one or two experiences, this place has always served great food. Keema kaleji and paneer tikka are also good."
3492,All you can taste is garlic . I will not order again.
566,The food was super chilly hot ! I ordered 2 different chicken dishes .... the both looked and tasted exactly the same ! I have ordered from this resturant before .. the first time the food was good but the second time it tasted totally different and really chilly hot .... the resturant doesn‚Äôt have consistency in the food !
566,I am a noodles freak but the noodles it's not upto my taste even the local one taste it better.
566,ITS A GOOD PLACE TO ORDER FOODS.  THE PRICING OF ITEMS ARE VERY GENEROUS.  THE FOOD QUALITY AND QUANTITY WAS EXCILENT.  ITS A DELIVERY OUTLET BUT THEY HAVE DINING FACILITY ASLO.
566,"Delicious chinese food ordered chicken chowmin and chilly patato. Very good taste and at responsible pricing. A thumbs up, will continue ordering."
311661,A v nice place for evening hangout. Tried peri peri soya sandwitch along with some drinks on shelf. It was really good in terms of taste. The guy at counter was pretty generous. Would like to try all veggie options.
311661,"They give you something beyond sandwiches in the name of donner, an unusual loaf of bread being one of its kind. The filling and choice of ingredients, dips and veggies are much better and enticing than a normal sub. Good to explore and better value for money than any regular salad sandwich."
311661,"I have ordered many a times from this place, but I was surprised to see that the food I received was stinking and thus was stale.  Taste is one thing but stale food from a restaurant is gross. A total 'No' when it comes to having hygiene food."
311661,I ordered Peri Peri soya doner today it was pathetic ...the bread was burnt. Hummus served with it tasted and looked old...the vegetables and entire stuffing wasnt fresh ....the soya was so bland. Tried for the first time and has such a bad experience.  Never ordering from here again .
311661,Food is very nice the best part of this restro this is basically take away counter but still they behave like dine in restroo they all treat well with the guest with his super duper hit donner really nice  Original chicken doner  Butter chicken rice bowl  But the negative thing is they have no visiblity  And next to this outlet one emty shop which feel like old builing  But food is really good   Keep it up
134,Good restaurant there's food is very testy and the the most amazing part is there service they provide a good quality of service and maintain the regulatory that was amazing.
134,Such a worst and bad quality food.  No presentation no taste no ambience . Avoid it
134,Moti Mahal is supposed to be well known for the North Indian cuisine. Visited on wed afternoon with friends was quite disappointed with the ambience as it has few cramped tables and section on 1st floor is blocked as it‚Äôs closed since ages.  The food was a let down too as they served burnt dal makhni which is their signature dish. The butter chicken was boiled and undercooked chicken in gravy. They offered to change the food but since it was served a bit late we didn‚Äôt have time.
18415346,"Okay so I ordered the following dishes: - Cajun spiced grilled vegetables in pesto sauce with steamed rice and it is worth tasting. - Lasagna, which made me fall for the dish all over again. - For desert we ordered salted caramel cheese cake which was creamy and ultra smooth. It was so fulfilling. Beautiful interiors, cute and cozy seating areas, variety of food items are offered, good crowd and well trained staff. We paid around Rs. 1200 approx. Satisfactory all around."
18415346,A good and nice little place that is good for some meeting or hanging out with friends. I went there with friends. We had a nice time here and had couple of food was good¬† and served nicely.¬† Polite staff and good customer service.¬† Definitely worth a try.¬† Good value for money.
18415346,"Great food overall. Small cozy place for a quick bite. I don't write reviews until I have tried a place more than twice. I have ordered from here atleast twenty times and been to the cafe a dozen times must say Vipul Gupta has done a brilliant job here! The service, food, ambience everything is good."
18415346,Went to Def. colony to visit my favorite restaurant there but unfortunately it was closed due to sealing problem. Hence while roaming around came across this place and there are no regrets. Its a small cafe located in the main market which you may easily miss passing by. The interiors were nicely done and the service guy greeted with a smile. We ordered couple drinks and mezze platter and a pizza which were superb ! This place is now my second favorite place in Defense colony. You must try the food here.
17953931,I initially started visiting it as it served decent Sheesha.... The place is actually overwhelmed by 1 OAK to be honest .... It has a cozy little area outside to sit which is nice in winters.... I would say the Chinese stuff is the best in food and drink are the usual which you can get everywhere.... The staff is courteous I must say and the service is also good.... One can drop in once in a while to chill ....
17953931,"Its a medium sized outlet perfectly placed in the city buzz and with paid parking available nearby.  Ordered few beer and couple of cocktails, honey chilli potato, chilli chicken and dahi kabab.. the chilli potato were crispy and the staff is real friendly and will make sure to keep you happy with their quick service.  Should visit this cosy place"
17953931,"Meraki Cafe is a decent place to visit where you may find all those regular drinks and snacks with live music.   üçÅFood - We had Honey Chilli Potato, Chilly chicken and Dahi ke Kebab along with beer. Honey Chilli Potato was hot and crisp. The chicken was juicy and tender. I loved the Dahi ke Kebabs, it was delicate and just got melted in mouth.  üçÅ Ambience - There is nothing very amazing about the indoor sitting area. The bar started getting filled as the evening passed on. The place was clean. They have outdoor sitting as well but you can't have your drinks outside.   üçÅService - The staff was courteous and quick in service.   P. S. - I had a good time here during my first visit."
17953931,"We ordered 1 chilly chicken dry, 1 hara bhara kebab, 1 old monk, 1 red wine. Talking about the ambience, it was more of a closed restaurant type place and had 2 floors where ground one was all empty on a Saturday evening and first floor was filled with people who wanted to smoke hookah and all.  Talking about food and drinks, they were awesome. Hara bhara kebab - 4.5/5 (so soft and juicy) Chilly chicken - 4/5 (perfectly cooked) Service - 4.5/5 Music- 3.5/5 (loud as per my taste)  Overall a nice experience. I would recommend it to people who want to have drinks, hookah and don't really care about the quality of ambience and music much. Also recommended for office people. They can really have a good time chilling and gossiping."
17953931,Compared to the prices of the cafe the quality wasn‚Äôt that good .
18400744,Excellent ambience and interiors. Staff is very prompt and helpful. Food taste needs a lot of improvement. Too much pepper in everything that we ordered - and everything tasted the same - it tasted like nothing ! The asparagus tempura sushi saved the day for us.  Washroom was clean and well maintained.
18400744,Great for a Sunday brunch. Went there with couple of my friends after a long and happening saturday night. The look and feel is comfortable. The staff is prom and food is yummylicious. Coming back super soon.
18400744,I must say this place is d definitely a more than one time visit super ambience staff is friendly food is delicably awesome. Thought the place is for alcoholic drinks as one can see the moment he/she enters@nonalcoholic drinks are a must try too specially frozen fever and strawberry pinnacolada! Great experience üç∑staff very very nice I think we are again visite number 31 üëåüëåüòãüòã
18400744,"Always on a trail to find the best places to dine in South Delhi, I stumbled upon Number31. Located in the Defence Colony Main Market, right next to Defence Bakery- you will instantly fall in love with the easy breezy vibes of this place.   Seldom do I find places where every dish I order is just bang on. This is one such place! We ordered- 1. Crab and Mango Sushi- one of the best and most refreshing sushis ever. Must must must try 2. Truffled mushrooms on toast- There are a very few places that serve truffles and being a truffle lover, this dish was very decent. Its served with french fries 3. Chicken dimsums- Love,love, love. Tender, tasty and instantly melts in your mouth. There were 4 pieces and we chugged them in under 6 minutes 4. Blueberry panackes- fluffy and soft; perfect and light 5. Ginger ale- An apt drink to complement what we ate. We ordered a green apple based drink before this but it was too sweet  The service is quick and ambiance uber cool. Can't wait to visit this place again! Happy eating üë≠"
18400744,"Number 31 is smack-bang in the middle of Defence Colony market and so loses out on space. It does have a nice, airy decor which is attractive for a dimsum lunch.  The food was tasty and was ready on time. Some dishes stood out while a couple were lacklustre.   The chicken Sui Mai was slightly disappointing as was the Prawn Har Gao which was too salty.  The standout dishes were the Thai Crispy Vegetables and the 5 Spice Lamb Gyoza with crispy lattice."
18247032,My order from Moets Oh Bao outlet is Chilly chicken and Veg fried rice. Both items were fantastic and tasty and the packaging wad quite good and also the food was fresh when delivered. Tasty food and must recommend food. Fast delivery . Must try .
18247032,I like it.They have great consistency.Had a delivered and ordered  Chicken Sweet Corn Soup Beijing chicken Sweet corn soup was amazing in taste.It had equal amount of ingredients and was nicely cooked.Chicken was fresh and i Loved it.In Beijing chicken a fried chicken with nuts and dry red chillies and this dish absolutely classic.Must try
18247032,Moets oh bao is an amazing place for asian food. We had ordered chilli paneer dry and veg manchow soup.  Items were made fresh and delivered quickly. Manchow soup was loaded with veggies and good in taste. Chilli paneer was also yum. Loved the food
18247032,I recently ordered veg clear soup from moets oh bao! The taste was too good with Amazing flavours.  It had good quality and quantity! Came in hot and well packed container.  Worth for money! Good service! On time Delivery!
18247032,I ordered a mix vegetable cantonese style and manchurian gravy from this amazing restaurant a few days back. The taste was really good. The delivery was fast. The rider took care of contacless delivery. The packaging was good too. The prices are not too high. A must try place.
730,Moets Curry Leaf is one of the best Restaurant in New Delhi. I have ordered Malai Kofta and Butter Naan. Malai kofta was excellent and Naan was crispy. Really liked the food. Highly Recommended.  My experience was simply awsome. Yummy food üòã
730,"Ordered Zafrani Malai Kofta ,Keema Matter and some veg dishes from this Place and all were so yummy.  Packaging was done nicely. Quality & Quantity was enough. Well done Moets. Keep it up."
730,"I loved their food and visited them often but i was shocked to watch their careless attitude this time. I went to get food packed from Defence Colony and placed my order at the desk just outside the restaurant. However, after placing my order i noticed that the cooks and staff working inside the restaurant were coming outside the kitchen frequently and were not wearing any mask or glove (the kitchen is small and has an entry just on the right side of the desk). As i was about to make payment, i raised this issue with the employee sitting on the desk, he then told me that i have informed the cooks and they will maintain the standards (mask and gloves). Even when i was discussing this with their employee, i again saw a north eastern cook entering the kitchen while bringing grocery from store room and was not wearing any mask or gloves.   To make things worse, when i asked for the manager, i was told that there is no manager. At this time, the least expectation is to follow proper sanitisation procedure to keep the customers safe but that is not their priority.  Please do not order food from them as the kitchen is not following proper sanitisation procedure."
730,Ordered drums of heaven and chicken malaise till.  It was delivered on time warm and with proper packaging.  The taste was amazing. It was full of flavors and cooked to perfection.  Really liked both the dishes.  Will definitely going to order them again.  Highly recommended.
730,Ordered fish tikka from this outlet. The food was delivered on time and with proper packaging. It was warm. The tikka was so juicy and cooked to perfection. I really liked the taste of the tikka. It was full of flavours. Really enjoyed it. Will order again
18363787,Khaana achcha tha.. Not bad bas isi tarah lage raho bhai.. Bahut aage jaoge aap aur aap ka restaurent.. Khaana achcha aur dressing bhi bahut badhiya. Staff behaviour is also bery nice.. We are impressed keep it up guys..
18363787,"Ordered the biryani, it was quite sad. Hakka noodles weren‚Äôt any better. What was expected to be comfort food for us ended up disappointing us further!"
18363787,I absolutely Loved their soya chaap and Unicorn fries. They were so beautiful and so good in taste. Flavours were phenomenal. Their fries are highly recommended!
18363787,I ordered Paneer Makhani and Butter Naan. Usually packaged naans disappoint me but this order I was different - I got four big pieces. Paneer and the gravy was yummy. What added charm were the two kinds of chutneys and a pack of salad. Definitely my go-to punjabi food ordering place from now on!
18363787,"The Culinary Pitaara did a great experiment with their UNICORN menu. In this, they have options like Momos, Fries and Kebabs that are presented with three different types of sauces BLUE, WHITE, RED. The taste that comes on top is so unique.¬†  I tried Unicorn Momos, Unicorn Fries and Tandoori Soya Chaap with Rumali Roti here. The chaap was however not made in gravy and served hot on a skewer only. If you are planning to visit this place, do ask for Unicorn menu related dishes as you won't find this in any other restaurant."
573,"this is a small restaurant, difficult to find place on a busy weekend. Its dimly lit, half of it has been closed due to ceiling. Food is mostly Indianized Chinese, not the best, though not bad either. Rates are relatively cheap. It has become a go to place for the youngsters for its drinks and cocktails being on the cheaper side. They definitely need to work on the cleanliness and the overall decor. Better places have come up nearby.¬† Recommendations: Chicken Manchow Soup, Butter Garlic Prawns, Lemon Coriander Pan fried Fish, Chilli Chicken dry"
573,"I think this place is underrated, yes you read it right! This is one of my favourite restaurants in South Delhi, just because of one amazzzinnng dish! And that's salt and pepper prawns! They are so good with prawns you cannot even think if it. I have also tried chilly pork, prawns noodles, and few more dishes all are exceptional. This restaurant is always full and there is a waiting mostly on peak hours. If you're prawn lover, you ought to visit this restaurant and grab your self a plate! Try their chicken too, I liked it as well. The staff is friendly, though the place is a bit congested, but that really doesn't matter if you're getting the best food."
573,"HOT HOT HOT......the way Chinese food should be ...... or Indianized Chinese ....wtever... just loved the food here. Had sweet corn coup, spring rolls, chilly garlic noodles n veggies in hot bean sauce n loved all of it."
573,First and foremost thing about this place is the ever smiling big moustache watchman on the gate. The way he greets you makes your day.  Visit for cheap booze and good food. Probably the ambience is not so good but the crowd is good over here.
303215,"Average taste, chose two kulfi, kaju kishmish and gulabo, both tasted somewhat similar, was expecting a better quality but was let down by the taste  Taste:4/10 Service:8/10 Ambience:1/10 Value for Money:5/10"
303215,"The quantity is not worth the price you pay. They could sell it at Rs. 30. Anyways, I found a hair in the kulfi. Never coming back. Disgusting & Gross!"
303215,One of the best kulfi and rabri I have tasted so far. Best part was the delivery was super quick and the items were super chilled and packed perfectly . Thanks for the awesome kulfi üëç
303215,"I ordered orange bomb kulfi yesterday and when i received the order, i was between disbelief and hunger! Disbelief because i never expected a frozen orange covered by a cling film to reach my door step! So i waited! Waited patiently for the orange to thaw so i could eat the pulp! After sometime i noticed an orange mush peeping though the middle: when i opened it-- voila! An orange ice cream! Very unexpected exterior and very tasty interior!"
303215,"It is a small kiosk in the main market near Moets. Their kulfis are awesome. I have tried kesar pista, mango, fruit cream, black currant. I am putting a picture of paan kulfi."
302655,"I have ordered Grilled chicken from this place,It was very tasty and freshly prepared also they deliver it on time .Their packaging was Biodegradable packaging. They delivered quality food and also with reasonable prices. Worth ordering food from this place!"
302655,I ordered for grilld chicken and tandoori chicken Grilled chicken was perfectly done.  Also loved the taste  Spicy but amazing Favourite place to order from.‚ô•Ô∏è
302655,"Why would you make the garlic sauce sweet? It's Lebanese cuisine. Hummus ,tahini or garlic are not meant to be sweet. I didn't enjoy my food."
18273615,"Been here a few times, always had a good time. Great place and great food üëç"
18273615,"Visited chatterbox, such a wonderful and decent place. Especially the ambience part. Simple sober and descent . . My orders- 1) Naan with daal makhni shots- The amazing plate with three small dal makhni shots. The beauty about this place is the presentation of food is very nice. 2) Chocolate Oreo shake- the shake was very good. It was full of chocos chips, brownies and ofcourse the way they decorated that glass was damn nice. . . Ambient-5/5 Service-4.5/5 Food taste-4/5 Food quality-5/5 Price worth-4/5 (if you are going with Zomato gold then it's very cheap for you. You will get one on one free on every dish) . . Give this place a try ‚ù£Ô∏è . ."
18273615,This place is really amazing I really love this place the ambience was really amazing this place is good I really love the food ambience place the staff was really good nice service it's located in Khan market why the name of the chatter house having a great comfortable seatings amazing food really enjoyed I came here with some of my friends for lunch I really enjoyed thank you so much for the great experience
18273615,"Chatter house is such an amazing place to be at. Had my lunch here which was simply perfect. They have such a wide variety of food available and the menu is curated beautifully.  Tried the soft sangria and the Long Island iced tea, both were really great. Also tried the mushroom satay with grilled vegetables which was really tasty. And tried the chocolate mousse in the dessert which was the best I have had in Delhi as a whole!"
18273615,"Went to chatter house the other day and it was a perfect lunch I had. The ambiance is so good, and the service was also quite amazing. Tried the chicken platter there which had dal makhani too. Also tried the mushroom satay with grilled vegetables which was also really delicious. Overall had a really good experience there."
103,"Veg Gulati:-  It was a marvellous experience Going to Veg Gulati restaurant situated in pandara road , ambience was very good there , staff was very courteous and service was very good. Now comes to major part , food that was very good there , especially Malai and Tandoori Chaap , so guys do have a visit to them and try their food."
103,"Went to Veg Gulati with my family friends for a brunch and trust me this place is perfect for all kind of brunch and family dinner. Ambience here is very sober and decent. Talking about the staff, their service was great and on time. We ordered their dahi ke kebab, soyachaap and tandoori mashroom for starter's. Soya chaap were extremely delicious and was very tender in taste. Tandoori mashroom is a highly recommended dish from Gulati- it was well prepared with lots of flavours. In main course we ordered Rajma chawal combo and Mahara thali. My personal favourite dish in main course was Rajma Chawal. In all we had an amazing time here üòä"
103,I absolutely loved veg Gulati's food it was so good everything was just perfect in taste.. staff was so courteous :D had wonderful experience! Good place for vegetarians :D
103,"If you are hard core vegetarian and want to have some delicious vegetarian food, then this is the must visit place. I recently visited this place with my friend and experience here was very amazing.  I tried :-  > Dahi ke kebab > Galouti kebab  * Both were very delicious and has melt in mouth consistency.  > I also tried their Maharaja thali - this thali has dal makhani, shahi paneer, diwani handi, rice, raita, dessert and one paratha. The dal makhani and shahi paneer were really delicious. Overall, I really loved this thali and one must should try this üëç  In desserts I had, gulab jamun and ksheeram. Both were supremely delicious üòçüòç   Will definitely visit this place again for sure üëç"
307822,"Nice place to have pizza with italian taste, good place to have good food with nice quality, must italian dish which attracts you, must vist ti have good meal value for money."
307822,How do you call yourself a Pizzeria Ristorante and screw up the only thing on your menu? The PIZZA! I had seen this place multiple times but happened to visit recently. Had no time so grabbed two slices. Margherita and the Venus Garden. I was so hungry and was so looking forward to eating it while driving back home. Was famished. The entire time I was eating it I kept hoping to find some taste in the god damn slice. But was disappointed. Not just the margherita but the other veggie pizza too had no flavor. The pizza felt dry and as if I was eating a salty bread. Not to forget the box that was given for the take away had a weird smell. Highly disappointed. I‚Äôm sorry for the harsh review but felt let down. The slices aren‚Äôt cheap and I expected better taste given how nice and authentic the place looks. Hope they work on the taste and texture of the pizzas.
307822,"The food was excellent, the staff were welcoming and polite the space was a little small but everything else was amazing"
307822,"A quick break at work, we decided to grab pizza at this cute little shop la vie pizzeria. Adorable ambience, friendly service and amazing garlic bread, mushroom pizza along with berry smoothie and ice tea. Just the Indian disappointments that they don't have ketchup."
4296,Got this super delicious raspberry macaroon. Absolutely loved it. So goood. Don‚Äôt have a good picture so this will have to do üòÇ
4296,"A bit pricy but the truffle pastry was delicious. In Macarons, caremal and chocolate Macaron is a good recommendation."
4296,The best place in town for desserts. üòç
4296,"The ambience is really nice and cozy. The seating is also slightly towards vintage British cafes. Coffee was nice but quantity is not that great for coffee lover. Had also ordered tomato pizza, they do ready to serve pizzas only so that is again a drawback. But the taste was good besides a feeling of eating a pizza which is  not fresh. Over all experience is towards positive."
1901,"Had a horrible experience with the waiter here. I ordered coconut water. It was freezing cold. I asked very politely him if he could please warm it a little bit as I could not drink something so cold. He scowled at me, saying ""Kyun?"". I said, ""bohot thanda hai, aap thoda sa garam kar dijiye."" He just shook his head aggressively and said, ""nahi, nahi ho sakta."" I asked, ""kyun?"". He said, ""kharaab ho jaayega!"". I said, ""agar kharaab hua to meri problem hai, aap kar ke to dekhiye."" He said, ""nahi, hum nahi kar sakte."" I then asked him to take it back, which he did with a smirk.¬†After a while, my friend and I left. He did not charge us for the coconut water but only for other things ordered. But it was quite an unpleasant experience talking to him."
1901,"The servers were unprofessional. We had just ordered lemon cheesecake, cafe mocha and cappuccino. Worst coffee ever. And the cheesecake was literally a piece of shit. Over priced. The price is more than big chill, just imagine!"
1901,"It's surprising that this place is still functioning. HIGHLY overpriced, horrible slice of cheesecake that tasted sour. The coffee was so bad, even after fixing. And the tables are stuck to one another, in order to accommodate more people."
1901,"Went on a lunch date with my wife here and decided to try out this place for the first time. We ordered Penne all Arrabbiata, My Kind of Pizza (with customized toppings) and orange juice. So here are my pros and cons:  PROS: 1. The place was clean. 2. The food was hot and fresh.  CONS: 1. The Orange juice had water mixed into it as the straw was CLEARLY visible at the bottom of the glass and the pulp of the orange floating at the top even after stirring the juice in the glass. It was returned. 2. Penne all Arrabbiata was utterly tasteless and NOT spicy at all. A new plate was offered but that didn't help either. It was returned as well. 3. Pizza was OK at best.  In all, the experience was bad and it is suggested/hoped that the staff takes the suggestion into consideration and the cook needs to better his cooking skills."
800,Best butter chicken and naan. Gravy was yummy and so good and nice chicken chunks. Definitely worth it.
800,Butter chicken is the best pick from Chicken Inn. Definitely 100% suggest this dish. SOft and fluffy naan. Worth my money.
800,"Butter chicken is one of the best and yummy, mouthwatering gravy. Love the portion and good soft chicken pieces."
800,This is one of the best place in the city. I had one of the best butter chicken i have ever had. Yummy and delicious gravy. Love it.
800,In Pandara Road a great place to visit. Very neat and clean ambiance and it was decorated well. Comfortable seating and arranged well.¬† Nice and attentive staff. Good food portion and delicious.¬† I will come again here.
308337,We ordered the following with ratings for each :-  Tostadas tasting platter -3.5 (the platter had three different tostadas)    Totopos/tortilla chips -3.5     Note-on Friday nights they had live music.
308337,Either I'm not too well versed with the given cuisine.. or the food really lacked flavor. The ambience is gorgeous but the chicken dish we ordered.. it was bland and the most flavour we got on the plate was from saut√©ed onions. I need to try this place again.
308337,"This is a cute Mexican cafe situated in our very own Khan Market. It is a quiet place with classical mexican music playing in the backdrop. This is where you can sit for hours and just enjoy yourself.  Coming to the food, we could not be the right judge but we didn't find it very tasty. We tried toastadas tasting platter and a vegetarian large plate dish whose name is quite difficult. Both were okay..was lagging behind in flavours. We also had churros in dessert (the reason for which we went there) and churros were good.  I would just recommend them to improve on food, otherwise the place and staff is good"
308337,"Quite surprised to see low ratings for La Bodega which features in my '10 best places to eat in Delhi'! I haven't been there in last 2 months, but having visited it quite a few times and being a foodie who savours authentic cuisines, i can vouch for La Bodega. If you are craving for real Mexican meal, look no further!¬†  Some of my all time favorites include:  Starters La Bodega's Margarita - The frozen one is best in town! Nachos platter served with Sour Cream & Guacamole¬†  Taquitos Dorados De Barbacoa with lamb Al Pastor with pork  Quesadillas Gringa Des Res with grilled steak (must order)  Botanas Ceviche Acapulco with seabass  Enchiladas¬† Arrachera Con Salsa De Cilantro with steak (another must order)¬†  DessertChurros Con Chocolate  All these finely flavored platters exude authenticity. Usually i am stuffed with starters and snacks and have not gone forward with larger platters. I am sure they deliver the same exquisite taste and quality as the ones i have savored.  The soft decor is pleasing and the fact that Smriti Goel (the owner) takes care of every guest on the floor is commendable. It has been a great dining experience each time. Summer is here and i am missing frozen margaritas...It is time to schedule a visit to La Bodega!"
308337,Great ambience! Their Quesadillas are mouth watering.. and also churros con chocolate. The staff is also very courteous and sweet. But perhaps they can improve on their speed. We had to wait for long for a greek salad.
803,I remember going for lunch here .. everything we ordered was quality .. will surely go back when I can
803,Was there in Sunday night ordered Butter Chicken and Chaap masala. I will give 2.5 to the food over here as the pieces of chicken in the butter chicken gave a feeling of Boiled chicken means the taste of the gravy or the marination has not oozed inside . The gravy taste was great . Now about Chaap masala the chaapa were little bit on harder side had to use force to break the piece . Service part was very good . Proper care was being taken. May be i will try it again.
305686,"So this place was like 3.5/10 for me as the service , ambience was good . The dumplings and the soup were well prepared and tasted quite good but the rice noodles were quite dry so we ate it along with a spicy chilli garlic sauce which tasted better than it was, this also depends on your taste buds but I found them not exactly what we Indians would prefer . So you can always ahead trying other sorts of noodles as well. It was an okayish experience but I would surely go sometime to try out something new as I do üå∏"
305686,"By the way, the restaurant is very good. But here is a little problem of eating. The food is a bit slow here and service also needs to be fast a bit. Everything else seemed right, it seemed a little less taste in the food, there is a  need to improve the service."
305686,One of the best south-east Asian food I have ever had in Delhi. The place has a very good ambience which makes you feel positive. I really liked this place.
305686,"We ordered for food from Sidewok-Khan Market,on Feb.14, 2020 for an office lunch for about 5 people... and least did we know that all of them shall fall terribly sick, after consuming it... to an extent that all the members who had the same food were hospitalized due to food poisoning. The items ordered were: Sliced chicken in black pepper sauce ; Stir fried tofu in chilli basil ; Ginger chilli garlic fried rice ; Veg. chilli garlic noodles ; Crispy veg. Pepper & salt. The food was delivered after almost 1hr,45mins. and was either stale or spoiled. All 5 members who ate the lunch from Sidewok were throwing up all thru the weekend and eventually had Dehydration & Dysentry. I have always appreciated the food we have had in the past from Sidewok Malcha Marg,but it was our first instance of ordering food from Sidewok Khan Mkt, thinking it would be equally good and would come thru the same channel of quality standards,but in dismay !  Highly disappointed and an alarm for the others too, to avoid having food from this place."
18419910,The food and drinks were so refreshing. Had a tired day. This is your place to be.
304989,"I'm soo glad for Choko La to have invited me to their Khan Market branch, I feel as though I have now become a chocolate connoisseur. As soon as I entered Mr. Pankaj the restaurant manager came with the menu and explained the brand identity aswell as the story quite in depth. After hearing about the origin of the brand, I was sooo eager to start tasting the items.  What I ordered - Dark and Milk chocolate beans - 4/5 Signature Hot Chocolate - 5/5 Irish Cold coffee - 4/5 Hazelnut Cold Coffee - 5/5 Blueberry cheesecake - 5/5 Belgian truffle pastry - 5/5  The chocolate beans were one of the finest quality I have ever tasted. They are specially imported and made with Cocoa Mass and Cocoa butter, hence no artificial flavouring - one has to taste these to actually feel the difference. Dark chocolate had - 55% chocolate and Milk had - 35%.  Signature hot chocolate - So this was recommended by Mr. Pankaj and you can easily call it the USP of the place. The texture is perfect and thick just how it should be, not watery at all, like most of the places. I would definitely recommend this as a Must try for everyone.  Irish and Hazelnut Cold Coffee - Most places I have tried Cold Coffee, the flavour has always got mixed and it's been difficult to make out. But the cold coffee here has the perfect taste of flavours and its strong aswell. Just how coffee should be.  Blueberry Cheesecake - So they make the cheesecake with pure Mascaporne cheese and Biscotti as the base. Also, they use real berries as the topping and not just berry syrup. All this makes the Cheesecake one of the most authentic pastries. This cheesecake beat some of the best patisserie's in town. Its hands down the BEST!  Belgian Truffle Pastry - It's a perfect melt in the mouth pastry, which such dense flavour of Belgian chocolate. The best part if you melt this pastry, it can become a perfect ganache.  All the products are made in their own chocolate factory, which I believe would definitely be a lifetime experience if I get to visit it.  Talking about the decor, it's a very lively place, however it doesn't feel noisy at all, the colours used are soo bright that sitting there makes you feel at peace. The service is very personalized and fast, like there wasn't a moment where I had to signal to the server, he anticipated the need on his own, which I believe is a very nice thing. Thank you Ankit üòä  After the food, I walked around the cafe and saw some other products they offer, the chocolate Box is one of the best gift options which I saw. Also they have this amazing cake which is Dark chocolate and Raspberry, so when you cut the cake there is Raspberry flowing out, it sounds soo divine that I bet it taste even better. Also, I got the vanilla flavoured hot chocolate mix, so now I can always taste this hot chocolate by just sitting at home, all I need to do is add hot milk. Yummmm!  I would highly recommend a visit to this cafe for everyone, they have some more branches so one can visit whichever is close for them. Thanks you ChokoLa, Pankaj and Ankit, you all made my visit soo worthwhile."
304989,"The only Chocolaterie of its kind in Delhi. A tiny bakery in khan market that caters to exactly 10 people at a time. Though people come, place their take away orders, buy their custom designed gifts, chocolates that are on display, buy breads etc. For me such bakeries that offer a seating, is often a place when you want to take a quick break for yourself and don't feel the urge of drinking cocktails. Just grab a book, sip coffee and enjoy the view.¬†  I was greeted by Ankit and Bini who took care the entire time. Though there were other customers as well and the greet with a smile was constant for them as well. You don't find those smiles often.¬† We started with an introduction of the chocolates they use for their cakes, pastries and chocolate bars. A small bowl with two kinds of chocolates was placed on the table. One was brown while the other was dark brown. The brown chocolate uses around 35% of cocoa while the latter had 65%. They are actually the best quality of chocolates for eating pure.¬†  Some tea and coffee came along since it had started raining. The weather called for it and then who does not enjoy a good cuppa during rains. For me it was a picture picture moment. Thin bodied Darjeeling tea was steaming hot. Preference based on the floral aroma it has. The coffee I requested for had medium coffee was served in a tall glass and tasted as per palate.¬†  Now, lets talk about desserts. The chocolate that goes in pastries. We gorged on Belgian chocolate pastry and berry cheesecake. Belgian -- its rich, moist and a perfect delight to indulge in the passion that's been used in the making of this chocolate pastry. Not drooling enough? Well, let me put it this way, this pastry is a luxury to gorge on. On every bite you could taste dark chocolate melting away. We loved it. While berry cheesecake is the opposite. Its loaded with berry goodness! So for people who have that extra sweet tooth, would like indulging. For me, it was a little too sweet and the¬† topping took away the entire applaud.¬†  So the next time, you wish to have a quick break just for yourself, you know where to head.¬† Thanks to Ankit, Bini and Yatarth, for being friendly enough, taking care, cooperating and being patient enough for me to get good pictures."
304989,This place is known for its great desserts! And it turned out to be true..  We ordered one belgian chocolate pastry and one coffee caramel pastry.. coffee being my fav flavour.. coffee caramel was truely heavenly! Chocolate pastry too was great.. thankfully it wasnt very sweet. Had a great experience. Must go place for all dessert lovers.
304989,Hot chocolate on a rainy day is something that I was looking forward to and Choko la made it perfect with its amazing Hot chocolate with a tint of Hazelnut. Along with it I ordered chocolate cruffin which was a new thing to try out. It looked like a muffin but was much more soft and the molten chocolate filled simply melted my heart. The shop is in the inner side of the Khan market. The sitting area is not too big but is nice. I loved the decor though especially the lights hanging over the counter. The music was soothing to the ears and the waiters were friendly and nice. Waiting to try out more stuffs from Choko LA! üòÅ
304989,"The cake was stale , it has no taste"
307284,This place is just Wow. Really love this place and their food is so awesome and their kebabs are the best. I am fan of this place and never miss a chance to go there. This is a must go place. Thanks.
307284,"Absolutely in love with this place. I could say literally dined in the porch and even though the space was little cramped up outside, the food and music made it one of best dinners I have ever had. The menu wacky broad printed with dishes. The ambiance us of casual funerals, no frills interior. The staff were courteous and attentive. Coming back soon."
307284,You can enjoy the rooftop view here. Not that big in terms of space. Food was delicious. I ordered pasta and paneer tikka. Decent ambience.
307284,"I visited this place few days back and it is very nice. I loved the open area balcony which was just amazing and so lighted up. The food was fresh and taste very nice, the food had a commendable quality and a great service. Nice experience, surely Recommeding it."
310674,This place serves great food.. beautiful ambiance.. and decent presentation.  The staff is friendly and understand the requirements. The food menu is excellent where you can find varieties.. overall. amazing experience.
310674,Overall theme was not up to as what was expected. Too many mirrors everywhere. Staff was courteous though. Ordered Mezze Platter- which was not up to the mark. The hummus was very dry.
310674,"I have given a rating of 3.5 to Cafe Illuminati only for the food and service as this place is way too small to observe and realise. We had a delicious Greek Salad which had the freshest possible veggies having the appropriate crunch and, thankfully, was not drenched in the dressing like other places I have been. Happy hours were on, so some beers and gin accompanied our salad. If my suggestion counts, I would look forward to them spreading out a bit as the seats are way too close where one might feel congested."
310674,Disgraceful service by the staff. Walked away rudely while we were seeking clarification on Zomato gold + happy hour. Misinformed us earlier on the applicability of Zomato gold + happy hour.   Definitely not coming back here again.
310674,Avoid this restaurant. Staff is not courteous at all. They took our order and later denied since we were using zomato gold. They denied the availability of the drinks which we ordered ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
462,"I ordered Chicken Burra, Mutton Sheikh Kebab & Mutton Biryani with Qameeri Roti.  Unlike the much hype, food was just above average. Biryani was less of its kind. I strongly recommend the chef to try out Lucknowi or Hyderabadi Biryani to match the essence.  Seek Kebab was spicy, oily & monotonous in taste.  Value for Money: 1/5 Taste - 2/5 Ambience - 3/5 Quality - 4/5 Service - 4/5"
462,Had been to Delhi and Karim's was always on the list. The place and ambience is very nice and quiet. The staff very friendly. Its famous for its Nihari but we tried chciken jahangiri and it was yummy. Perfect blend of spices n too good in taste. Tandoori roti was also good. Surely a must visit in Delhi.
462,I'm a big fan of muglai.Food in Karims in Jama Masjid is absolutely amazing. This branch did not live up to it. Don't go expecting the same Karim
462,"Pathetic food packaging..pathetic is the word!! Ordered nihari and roti and this is how it was packed. The restaurant itself delivers. The nihari was in a plastic bag with a dori to fasten, drenched in oil. it was for 450 rs and came delivered in a very unappetising, dirty and harmful packaging. Same was the case with roti."
462,One of the best cuisine .... Must give a try guysüòãüòãüòãüòã
312710,Did a birthday brunch here .. tried the unlimited dimsum lunch with a friend.. I personally liked the vegetarian dimsums better than the non vegetarian ones. Food is great. In terms of service... female staffers were all friendly and quick to respond.. the male staffers were rude and unhelpful.. I don't know why though.
312710,"Unbelievably atrocious quality of food. First of all, the glass in which the water was served was stinking and secondly, the prawns that were served were not properly cleaned, resulting in giving me a skin allergy which i had never experienced before in my life."
312710,"The service staff was super arrogant and the waitress seemed to be doing us a favour by serving us at 11 pm. Shouldn't have been open if you can serve. The dimsums were pathetic and over steamed after we told them that it was not fresh. Overall, it was an experience I wouldn't want to have again"
312710,"It‚Äôs such a beautiful place, I absolutely loved it. The cocktail was super yummy. I had a cosmopolitan, vegetarian bao and pan fried dimsums. Everything was delicious. Will definitely go again for the cocktails and dimsums"
303599,"Loved the nihari, khameeri roti, sheermal and mutton kebabs. The uncle running this shop is so passionate about his craft and lives up to the reputation of amazing food and hospitality."
303599,"No words to describe how good this place and their food is. The tikka, kababs, nihaari and the khameeri roti are to die for. Highly recommended. Just amazing, and prices are great too. To the people who are complaining about cleanliness or indecent crowd, what are you expecting? This is not a gourmet place, this is a rustic shop which is running since 65 years, and they do total justice to their food."
303599,Great place to hv Muglai food.. no drill restaurant situated near Nizamuddin Dargah ... tasty Kababs ... will surely visit again.
307370,Coffe was excellent. Ordered fish & chips & paneer sandwich. Portion of chips was so small & so was the crisps in the other dish. Asked for a bit more & was refused saying that was the portion size. End of story.
307370,A decent place to get your brew be it coffee or tea. The brand tries to bridge the gap and serve both beverages however confuses the customers in the process. Slightly overpriced for the product.
307370,Best coffee!!
307370,"perfect place to be in Delhi winters , the location is good and so is the service . Excellent coffee ,though few of the items on menu were not available , the Omlette was very tasty .¬† Good place to hang out with friends."
307370,"One of the best places to have coffee. Hazelnut latte and white chocolate latte stand out from the rest and other coffee shops don't even come close. Special mention for Shubham, the coffee chef for his skills and hospitality."

18082237,Very pricey and not so worthy
18082237,They have a really good hot chocolate and the staff is really courteous
18082237,"The Artful Baker, along the front row shops of Khan Market is a high end patisserie offering great range of cakes, coffee and savouries. Though this bakery has a very limited seating(7-8 people) but their menu is pretty extensive and has an extremely tempting array of freshly baked goods including croissants (sweet and savoury), quiches, muffins,sandwiches, cupcakes, cakes, tarts, mousse and more. Coffee, tea, and cold pressed juices are also available. I am in love with their interiors which are tastefully done( just like their desserts). Their display was visually appealing and made me drooling the minute I entered: Rows upon rows of exquisite, decadent, pretty-as-a-picture desserts- totally Instagram worthy! Indeed, the name of the bakery is ""Artful""- pure beauty. As this bakery has plethora of options, it was a difficult task to select desserts but I finally zeroed in on a few of the options from their Valentine's pop up menu.  My top picks from their Valentine's pop up menu-  1. Venetian Tiramisu- the eternal favorite, tiramisu with a hint of citrus and chocolate layered with the creamy, whipped mascarpone. I relished this heart-warming dose of bliss. 2. Duet- One of the most prettiest dessert which is a duo of Belgian chocolate and vanilla bean mousse with maraschino cherries; It is rich,intense and velvety. Being a chocoholic, I was blown away by the texture and taste of this decadent dessert 3. Mocha bundt cake-An exceptionally rich and moist delicious cake with subtle coffee flavor. Bittersweet chocolate and coffee paired up beautifully to deliver the distinctive taste of this decadent delight. 4. Strawberry and white chocolate muffins-Moist, fruity and chocolaty fresh strawberry muffins . Texture of these muffins is absolutely divine 5. Strawberry pannacotta- delicious, creamy, and delicate dessert.It was so light and refreshing. 6. Grilled vegetable melt- grilled vegetables with balsamic onion, cheddar and sundried tomato pesto on multigrain bread  Special mention for their Almond milk cold coffee- very few places in Delhi make perfect vegan cold coffee. I am happy to discover this gem which makes perfect coffee. All in all, The Artful Baker is a heaven for dessert lovers. They serve droolworthy indulgent divine desserts crafted with such perfection. I am definitely visiting this place again to treat myself to some soul-soothing yummies and gorging on their freshest bakes.  Follow my food journey on Instagram- teekhi_mircheee"
18082237,"Certainly one of the Best Hot Chocolate, I have ever Had...... üíò"
2902,"Excellent food. Good service. It's a dhaba in South Delhi's posh area - Sunder Nagar where you will find all kinds of people dining in and that is the best part! People coming in their BMWs and Porsche simply love to dine at this place and why not?! The food is simply delicious especially their Dal Handi, paneer tikka, Sarson ka saag and hot crispy tandoori rotis/ lachha parantha/ butter naan! It's a great place for pure vegetarians. Although it's an open air dhaba, they have now partially covered a small part of it.  Best time to visit - During winters when you can truely enjoy their hot, mouth watering food served next to coal angeethis !  Two things that I didn't like - Chaap and Dal Makhani. Instead go for Dal Handi (Also a black dal)"
2902,Total waste of money n precious time .. pathetic service ..............don't waste ur money..........
2902,"Love the tandoor food here. This is an only veg place right in the heart of the city. Sunder Nagar ‚ù£Ô∏è. Aloo Tikka, Paneer Tikka, Soya Tikka are really good. Dal & Kadhai Paneer are good too. Indian sweets like ras malai, indian mithaais, fruit cream, ras gulla, etc are great üëçüèª"
2902,"Allo tikka of this place is my fav!! I have been here so mamy times in the past few year and the taste never disappoints meü§ó although in my last few visits, i feel that the quantity is way too less for the price we pay (that too without any comfortable ambience). One full plate dal makhni was sufficient only for one person."
4302,"Pretty often, I order the vegetarian Thali from this place and I am always satisfied with the flavours and quality.  The price point is decent, not expensive, portions are just right and the quality of food is good too.  I like the fact that the food is not greasy or overly rich, neither is it too plain.  Complete value for money."
4302,Awesome service
7876,this even doesn't need one star also. worst food i ate in my life from here .. please don't but food from here.
7876,I ordered fried rice and mix veg roll...the roll was not cooked properly...its taste like raw...nd i feel they use eggs for the roti part...which is not ethical if someone is ordering a veg food.
7876,"I had ordered 1X Chicken Garlic Noodles and 1X Chicken Fried Rice. My order Id is¬† 2031898557. As in noodles there is no flavour of garlic and also the chicken pieces are very hard as well as noodles also. And in Chicken fried rice, the chicken pieces and the rice which is used in this is very hard to eat and the taste is also very bad. The food is pathetic. I would never recommend to order from this restaurant.  My ratings would be 1 out of 5. Very disappointed. Zomato should have a check on his resaturants food quality."
7876,"I did not order this from Zomato but it's important you people should know about this. I have overlooked their lack of hygiene several times in the past but, this is unacceptable. I ordered a double egg double chicken roll from this restaurant via Swiggy. Half way down the roll, I find something smelling really bad and when I took it out I found it was a rodent excrement. Yes! They put rat shit in my food. This restaurant should be closed down and they should check on where they are lacking in basic hygiene."
312173,Yummy butter chicken. I have been ordering (delivery) from Zaaika for sometime now and have never been disappointed. There butter chicken is one of the best I have had here and they deliver the food on time aswell.
312173,"Pathetic services, waste of money, ordered food but got after 1 hour 30 mins, pathetic food and restaurant, not even worth a single star, .."
312173,Best way to enjoy a pack an carry meal. Food is good quality and tasty. Also we didnt have to wait much for our parcel.One should try it ...
312173,THE most sickest of places u will find in south delhi and I would call a mole in south delhi.superrrrrr late delivery and phone is unreachable for two hours now.the sites like Zomato and foodpanda endorse this joint even after having the best of sad reviews. Pls never order from here
312173,"This is something very disappointing which I faced today.. I ordered a paneer dhaniya adraki and daal and rotis.  Paneer was ok.  Bt to my horror there was a bolt ( screw ) in my daal can u Believe it.. and when My husband called the restaurant instead of apologies the person said it is not there fault and they have not done. When we said we will take legal action against them , they were like jo karna h Karo... this so pathetic.  This is not the first time we orders food from here bt this kind of behaviour is really not at all acceptable.."
18358157,"Delicious food, friendly staff, great price go out with your family and friends and enjoy a perfect meal. They have more options other than Chinese food."
18358157,Paneer was really sad
18358157,I ordered a Butter chicken and it was super yummy. The quantity of a quarter chicken is more than enough for 1 person. Packing was good and overall it‚Äôs a 5 star thing if we consider the price and taste.
18358157,"Till now, Quality Quantity and taste met the expectations.very good flavours and soft chunks of fish. Great job chef !  Recommend : Any seafood dish Price for two : Rs.500"
18358157,Delivered hot
18391937,Amazing parantha rolls! Love it. Would recommend everyone to go for it for a quick light bite. Not very oily and doesn't hurt the pocket much either!
18391937,Awesome rolls!! The bread quality is amazingly fresh with freshly prepared ingredients. Love the place. The rates are very genuine and the portions are very filling. Highly recommended for all youngsters out there!!
18391937,It's an awesome place to kill that hunger with mouthwatering rolls. The rolls are filling and economical at the same time. The freshly prepared parathas are what add to the freshness I would definitely recommend this to all my peeps.
18391937,"Nice rolls, as their name halka fulka and garma garam,   nothing require after two rolls ,one can prefer it for lunch as well as supper .  Also very economical ....... *****"
18391937,"Halka fulka rolls are amazingly satisfying...i have been placing order from here since quite long now and the most that I love is their signature roll, It is the tastiest roll i have ever eaten. This place is amazing the location is also really nice. It is a very nice experience to be there. Loved the services!"
7884,"we ordered shahi paneer with Dal makhni & chappati, Shahi Paneer was the most pathetic taste we had ever, when we dial foodland and complain about the same the person over the phone was very rude and talked nonsense. this is how they server customer. i will not recommend food land to anyone."
7884,I love the food of this food land its tasty and fresh and well cooked..dilvery also is good.momos was amzing..thali and snacks were amzing mast try the chilly patato and tawa chaap
7884,Last night I ordered chilly potato.... Really yummm potatoes with lots of crispy capsicum and onion.... Awesome feeling after having that long chilly potato with yummy ‚ÄòTil chutney ‚Äô  Quantity was tummy filling... Highly recommended... Must try Til chutneyüëåüëå
7884,"Foodland is questionable. It's not very clean but has good options in food. The space isn't large but prices are cheap. So it's right there in the middle when it comes to decision making.  But the food here is tasty, so that's always a big plus."
7884,I was really disappointed in the food that i ordered from your restaurant recently. I had to throw the whole mutter paneer since the pieces of paneer in it were stinking and stale. Whole dish tasted unpleasant. I don't know how you serve your customers with such stale rotten dishes !!
920,"My favorite restaurant for ordering food for dinner and lunch, they are superb in take away and the packaging  part is best and of course the taste of the food is delicious, me and my family really like the food from shivv shakti vaishno bhohnalqya üòãüòãüòã"
920,I ordered a veg thali the food was pathetic ..uncooked ..such bad ever I tasted.. Don't waste your time and money since they change extra and selling such bad food
920,Good food. Awesome people. Although there is a lack of good seating arrangement. The food is very good and tasty. I prefer to order from this place rather than go there.
920,"I've such Pakoda's, where after eating my stomach got upset and I¬†get to know it was prepared 3 days before and keep in the freezer and post ordering they just deep fry to serve where the quality gets decreased."
18266888,"One of the best restaurant for NORTH INDIAN FOOD We ordered Afgani chicken, Dal makhani, Paneer naan, Fresh lime soda & Raita Great food with good experience Quick service  Easy to locate and pocket friendly place to visit"
18266888,"i orderd to this delhi rasoi mutton curry, Rara mutton,egg cury, gulab jamun, butter chicken, chicken hundi and chicken fried rice every item was very tastefully‚Äã.  Rara Mutton 4/5 Egg Cury 3/5 Butter Chicken 5/5 Chicken Fried Rice 4/5 service was really very nice. i really enjoy everything from this delhi rasoi... thank you delhi rasoi"
18266888,"Since I have been on a spate of exploring the delivery outlets of Delhi NCR, I have experienced the preparations of a handful of them and needless to say, there are few of them which leave an everlasting impression on me. Delhi Rasoi is one such outlet which scored a 5 on 5 when it came to providing an enriching culinary experience while sitting in the comfort of your home. The order arrived well in time and here are the delicacies that I relished on:"
18266888,"I ordered food from this place as I was not in mood of having some home made food. They have quite a variety of dishes. As being a non-veg lover I had mutton rara, it was perfectly blended with spices. From a long time I haven't ate such good mutton. Paneer paranthas were well stuffed and nice. Chicken dum biryani was well cooked and delicious. Packing was nice and food was delivered on time. I liked this place and will look forward to order from this place again"
18266888,"Recently, I ordered food from this place and liked it too much.. It was well packed and delivered on time. I would love to order again.... I ordered butter chicken which was prepared well. Chilli chicken was also good. Garlic naans were tasty and hot.... Highly recommended place for visit...."
9891,Half kg ke 4mangya tha 400pay kiya maine is porthion biryani ka fruad h yeh iski shops bnd kraoooo
9891,Very disappointed with the quality of biryani.......... ..................................................................... ..... ...............
9891,The worst restaurant I have seen in my entire life. This restaurant is a cheat as they don't deliver the quantity of the food as mentioned. Not recommend at all. Don't order from this restaurant.
9891,R u kidding me???I ordered half quantity of chicken and they delivered one leg piece just in that ....that was not even a quarter ...bye bye zomato ..never trust this seller ..Al Laziz ..pathetic service horrible ..DNT waste ur money with this shop
303625,Good food at a resonable price without onion n garlic
303625,i would like to tell you that the dal makhani is really aawsme
303625,"It was a horribly awkward situation. I ordered Dal Makhani, Aloo Naan and Tandoori Roti. Tandoori Roti however, was by far most delicious.  But the other two that I did order was pathetic.  I'd like to launch my protest in that."
7893,Chocolate brownie with ice cream and chocolate sauce is a must try from Cafe Coffee Day. Good quality food.
7893,"Due to some work I need to wait at ccd, I have ordered a black coffee, after that I was waiting for one call which i need to attend and need a quiet place to attend it and i thought ccd would be right place. But there is some staff who was just keep roaming around me and waiting for my black coffee to finish so either he ask me to leave or either to order something more for continue sitting at ccd. Even whole ccd was empty. Still they wanted customer to move out. This was not at all acceptable from ccd."
7893,"The CCD here is just beside the metro station. We ordered Potato wedges, they were served without any dip, unlike all other CCD joints. The coffee was also just average. When asked about the dip they did not answer. They can definitely improve the quality and service here."
7893,This outlet is much better than its neighbouring outlets coz of its ambiance and simple decent interiors.  The best thing that I like about CCD is their cafe frappe along with sandwiches and garlic bread.
312605,"Located in a small lane infront of Amar Colony, the restaurant is not a big place but is famous all over Amar colony for it's chicken dishes or non veg dishes...especially Chicken biryani,Mutton Biryani, Chicken Nihari, Chicken roll etc.  Better than unchi dukan and fika pakwaaan!!!"
312605,Best place for Chicken Biryani. Authentic Delhi food when it comes to Chicken/mutton. Non-Vegetarian Paradise. Sophistication is key here. Must visit if you are in Delhi.
312605,"I have got excellent experience for chikin Nehari,chikin Biryani..... I full enjoy my weekend at khan dilli6....home delivery was excellent.... No doubt if you want to"
312605,Economical for guys like me. Chicken biryani is value for money. Rest of the recepies normal. Of you are looking for chicken biryani at a mouth watering price you can go for this resturant.
312605,Worst chickn biryani i eva had !! That ws very disappointng .. Chickn had very small pieces and its lookng like its not a chickn but its somethng else..
18381237,Really mesmerising place to sit and smoke. My love for interaction spaces makes the place soothing to spend the evening but the food has spoiled it all. The food was not at all tasty. Breads were cooked in low heated tandoor hence breads were tight. Butter chicken was not at all upto the mark. It was just a chicken pieces in a gravy with extra use of food colors. Soya chaap masala was again the same dipped in a sweet gravy. It was masala please add some. Service was quite good and polite but they should learn about dishes also. Yummy Tummy
18381237,"Whenever I order Shahi paneer, my only concern is either it tastes apt like Shahi paneer should, or it succumbs to a medicine kind of taste, which most low end delivery restaurants offer. The Shahi paneer meal I ordered from this place was just ok. The Shahi paneer was tasting decent, although in between apt and medicine flavour, so can be improved. Disappointing part were the Naan. Didn't feel fresh and felt as if we're just heated later, had blackness from tandoor and ruined the taste somewhat. Pls avoid such things , they are noticable and become a part of flavour. Rest impressed by low price. No extra delivery charge or packaging charge."
18381237,Ordered food at home for a family dinner ...really awesome food ....thanks to the team of Spice tree for organising..the perfect dinner dates.Appreciated ...and looking forward for the same hospitality in near future .thanks   Mrs Arora
18381237,Was here last night with friends ... spice tree has a good outdoor seating . Ordered chicken malai tikka and soya malai for starters ! Was very tasty..soya was soft n melt in mouth.. main course was also Delicious.. prices are reasonable and good food ! Did order a cup of hot coffee in the chilly outdoor weather in the end
18381237,"Best restruant in the world .best soya and paneer tikkas and rolls ever eaten.chinese is awsome and the service quick and very neat ,execellent location and best food item is soya malai"
7886,Ordered Manchurian and it was bad I've never tasted such bad taste ever before it did not even tasted like Manchurian it was like some kofta and in some very very spicy gravy my stomach got upset afterwards even my throat started paining and I had only one spoon of it threw away rest
7886,The food was very nice. Service was very quick
18371426,best place for vada pav
18371426,"Authentic flavors, mouthwatering, pocket friendly"
18272344,"LaDiDa is a place to be. Yesterday, Prerna, Athrav Sachdeva and I were feeling to eat cup cake and incidentally we all were nearby to East Of Kailash. So we went into Eat Love Pastry also know as LaDiDa. We were immeasurably impressed by their techniques of cuting Macaroons to impress us. We eat Raspberry and Dark Chocolate Macaroons and Dark Chocolate Cup Cake. It was indeed a special night with friends!"
18272344,"I am not someone who would want to put on extra calories by eating sweet stuff, but her innovations makes me change my mind and indulge in them completely. I have tried her Lemon Meringue (out of the box flavor ), Coffee Chambrule (smooth and crisp both in the same bite) and THE¬†JD Honey Cup Cake :D........ this cup cake will automatically take you to a different world. It was a perfect blend of chocolate with deep indulgence in JD Honey... Yummylicious!!!!!! I want to have it more and more and more....Its a must try :) THE BEST PART IS SHE CAN BAKE ANYTHING YOU DESIRE, YOU JUST NEED TO WISH AND THERE IT IS :D"
18272344,Jeneva's personality sparkles through in her rich decadent orange-chocolate gateau and the fluffly flirty lemon meringue. I am now far too curious about her salty caramel and JD cupcakes that seem to be doing the rounds at fancy high teas...
18272344,"If you ever wondered what heaven was like, peek into LA DI DA. Pamper you palette with a variety of godly goodness starting with the choicest of macarons to The Magnificent (which by the way, is also superb!) Lemon Meringue. Each pastry is a treat for the senses not just in taste but also in its presentation. The perfect choice for any celebration or just simple indulgences in life! Now go play God and be merry!"
18272344,"I was introduced to LADIDA at a friends birthday party, and I fell in love!. Deserts from LADIDA are treat to all the senses! they taste heavenly, because the technique is right, and the ingredients are really high quality. The richness in red velvet and high grade bitter sweet chocolate used, prove that. The flavors are innovative, you feel the chef has put in heart and soul! They look beautiful, a piece of art almost.All in all, the deserts seem as if they are designed and crafted!.  The cakes make me think..if I could bake, this would have been a dream.  And yes, I haven't been able to pick ""a "" favorite :)"
9887,"I had snacks in this restaurant namely Imarati, samosa and rabdi. This place is not hygienic at all.. Snacks were stale except samosa. Very average taste."
9887,"This place is close to my house. I tried it's samosa, Bread Pokada and Rass Malai. Samosa was very good in taste. It had a good stuffing and had very good flavours. But their bread Pokada was not tasty at all. It was very dry and stuffing was not good. Rasmalai was good in taste. Prices are reasonable. One could vist for light snacks etc."
9887,"The sweets are OK. The staff are extremely untrained and impolite. No drinking water, no wash basin. One is directed to a washing place for utensils, filthily dirty for washing hands.  The amrity was stale. Gulab jamoon cold and hard. Extremely disappointing, wouldn't recommend anyone ever."
9887,"Just a few days back, there was a party at my office and we ordered samosas from this shop. to our disgust, we found that there were insects inside the samosa. At least three of us found different insects like honey bee, flies etc. I am attaching a picture for others to see, Very unhygienic food outlet."
9887,Bikaner at Sant Nagar is pretty average. They have competition with many shops around like Agarwal sweets. But they still serve decent chowmein.
7897,"Food: 4.5 Staff and Service: 4.5 Ambience and Character: 4 Value for Money: 5  Ordered Veg Pizza slice, Fruit Veg Muffin, Vanilla and Chocolate Pastry. It is a small outle and has no seating space, standing space for 5-7 people at a time. All the pastries are eggless, sweets are cooked in desi ghee and no onion or garlic used in any food iteam. Pizza slice was tasty. Vanilla and Chocolate pastry were very tasty, made of fresh bread and cream. Fruit Veg Muffin was awesome in taste, mouth watering. Its an economical confectionary."
7897,Pocket friendly sweets and savoury things. The freshness is assured as the footfall is plenty. The coffee cakes are yummy. Loved the besan ke and narial ke ladoos.
7897,"Had heard a lot about Govinda at Iskcon but unfortunately had never been able to visit.¬† Luckily was around the area with free time and hence visited the temple and restaurant with a friend. We started at the bakery for sweets and snacks. Had peda,motichoor, besan and atta laddoo, kulfi, milk, bread pakora, samosa etc.¬† The besan, atta laddoo‚Äôs where exceptionally soft and yummy, peda had hear was divine but we found it quite hard maybe wasn‚Äôt fresh). Sweets where exceptionally sweet. The fried items where just average, nothing exceptional. The temple is huge and has beautiful paintings of Krishna/Rama adorning all walls inside the temple. There was a Priest of north- east decent who seemed like a conducting the aarti¬† in a magical manner, his hand movement where so divine and articulate as if you were noticing a veteran magician, wish had taken a video.   Post the visit, we tried the buffet at the restaurant. The food is onion and garlic free and still tasted appetising. Nothing exceptional, except the effect of eating at ISKCON. Only a one time visit for me ."
7897,We got rusks from there. Very tasty. Rest they had pastries and cookies. Not that great. I was missing jalebi there somehow. But if you are at iskon them its a must visit:)
7897,"Love thier Prasad wala cake, blueberry cake....cheese roll.. muffins and other deserts... Moreover they are eggless, so every one can eat anything specially a vegetarian like me.....hygenic and fresh."
181,I wen to Mcdonalds.One the well known fast food outlet who started his business with a basic hamburger and then later in fries.I liked the food.The environment was also good but the seevice provided was not up to the mark.I ordered
181,"Well who doesn't know about our beloved McDonald's restaurant. I've been a regular customer of McD and their Maharaja Mac, McAloo Tikki and their one of the most selling item McPuff.  I don't think one should rate them less than 5 because of their pocket friendly pricing and taste."
181,"This is our all time favourite place. Their Chicken Nuggets, McAloo Tikki Burger and Spicy Chicken burger are really delicious."
267,"Its depends upon your luck. Sometimes the pizzas you order are not worth eating, sometimes the pizzas are prepared amazingly. The pizza here has variety, with a compact sitting place. The garlic bread from this place is satisfactory. Go for combos than taking individual pizzas"
267,"I‚Äôve always been a fan of Pizza hut. Their pizzas are amazing and so is their garlic bread sticks, cheese garlic bread, and pasta. But this outlet needs some repairing. Most of the times their Acs are not properly working and it doesn‚Äôt even have enough seating arrangement."
267,For my birthday party i ordered pizza's from pizza hut yesterday. I ordered veggie supreme n country feast n both were cheesy n tasty n the crust was soft. Definitely recommend!
267,"Very hospitable place to have dinner with family....I had a great time with my family, the service was so quick & food was very delicious...."
267,"We ordered cheese max pizza and garlic bread today. For a pizza named cheese max, the cheese was pretty min.. that tasted like mayonnaise. Also, the bread seemed to be stale. The garlic bread however, was okay. I feel like this place has no consistency.. sometimes their food is good but sometimes it fails the benchmark set up by the Pizza hut chain. Would prefer dominos any day."
927,Great place to hang out with companion. To have a decent time you should locate a decent seating yourself on the off chance that you are going there for a first time . The vibe here is fine. This place is generally swarmed. The nourishment was really fine and the beverages were incredible. A decent place to toss or appreciate parties and have some great sustenance.
927,I have ordered tawa chicken from this place way too many times. And its perfect each time. The tandoori chicken is delicious too. Juicy and perfectly cooked (not burned like many tandoori chicken out there) The only issue here is the price of everything on their menu. But i would still say its all worth every penny. Never been disappointed ordering from here.
927,f
927,order not received on time. it was melted and smelled.i sent it back to restorent.
927,Low rating for late delivery despite being near
5325,‚ÄúFabulous place to dine with a glass of wine and food is like divine......‚Äô‚Äô Loved the ambience..must visit place...highly recommended...
5325,Ultimate food with the best city view.
5325,Authentic Chinese food offered here. We ordered dimsum basket which was quite delicious but was very overpriced. The overall food quality was good. The thing which I most liked about the place was the view from our table.
5325,The Pan Asian streat food is phenomenal. We love the food and ambience was excellent with great services!! Also I would recommend you to definitely try sushi and green apple mojito
149,"I ordered one 12 inch teriyaki sub , and one chocolate cookie. I recieved one wrap one sub amd no cookie. I ordered for 485 rs amd have probably recieved food worth less than 400. This is unacceptable."
149,Never ever order anything from here.  If they don't have any items they will send item according to their choice. 2 times I have ordered from here for home delivery and both times I got wrong items. There executive gone out of Thier mind I guess.
149,I have been to this place for 2-3 times as of now. They make good subways and the staff is also courteous. I had Chicken tandoori and aloo tikki subway. It was really good.
149,Ordered a subway recently. was very hAppy with the way they made it. The sauces put were a lot and the veggies too. From a chain like this we expect the best and healthy meals I have a really good experience the last time I ordered.
18237363,"This has been the best chinese restaurant in New Delhi for me. Chicken soup and all the noodles were always delicious.The staff was polite, ambience was best.I have stopped eating chinese since you guys closed."
18237363,Closed for dining without any intimation. The place looked shady as well. Not sure why Zomato didn‚Äôt update this information on the restaurant page.
18237363,"Horrible experience, too spicey food the quality of rice was even worst than a roadside eatery Had order chilly chicken and rice from deal of the day section , its better such outlets should not participate in such deals"
18237363,"any eating outlet when offering two dishes in a combo, they must come in separated containers please! they can't mix it for me!"
18237363,Horrible food quality. Kungpao chicken tasted more like INDIAN dish full of spicy masala and tofu was such bad quality. Had to dump the food
212,No mask in pics posted regarding covid 19

302945,"Awsome malabar biryani, & staff"
1023,"Hello guys.... So today were at new friends colony.. I tried choco lavaüòç I m not sweet lover but i love to eat choco lava cake. And u must visit this place for so may food like pizza, rolles, biriyani etc"
1023,I recently ordered their almond chocolate fudge cake. There cake was fresh and delicious in taste.  Must recommended!!!
1023,Probably the worst bakery product I have had in years. Bought eclairs which was stale and the icing gave me throat infection. The cheesecake was too sweet and hardly had cheese cream. The mud cake pastry was awful. Couldn't have served worse pastry than this!! Not recommended.
1023,"I ordered a cake for my sister, it was a customised Unicorn cake; it was very well and beautifully made and the taste was so yummy that we couldn‚Äôt stop eating. My sister was very happy to see and cut the cake. Overall the experience was awesome and I would recommend it to everyone."
9671,"Shreeratnam a south Indian foodie's delight The que at this place tells u how much people love the taste and the flavour of this place well under the budget line and highly authentic South Indian food to offer, this place is a lunch time delight for anyone working there and for others as well in general A must try if u wanna enjoy the authentic South Indian taste without actually going there"
9671,We stopped at this restaurant to have something to eat as we were really starving..so we decided to have food at this place as the name suggested we ordered masala dosas and hakka noodles and to my surprised hakka noodles were well prepared and yummy . Dosa was good crrunchy and tasty but only one thing which was not upto the mark was sambhar..otherrwise we had a good nice dinner..
9671,Shree rathnam is definitely a good option for south Indian food. The food here is very good and their dosas are always perfect. good service by staffs as well.
9671,serving an amazing food the dosa and idli were amazing soft and crispy dosa tasted very well the sambhar.the plating was also amazing and the service also was goood
9671,The food here is fresh and authentic. Made really well. Totally worth coming and eating. Don‚Äôt judge the place by its location. The food is actually great.
1508,My colleagues for my birthday cake from here! Chocolatious it was üòç liked it! When it comes to chocolate cakes I am very particular about how they should be and this one was nice!
1508,The cakes are good.
1508,"Angels in my kitchen has several outlets spread all over delhi. This place is famous for its mouth watering menu of cake, bakery products and a lot more! I have tried few of its pastries, brownies, savory items and I seriously love all the delicacies. Also, this place is perfect for special occasions and festivities with their assorted collection of beautiful hampers, gift boxes and so much more.  Best quality and super worthy stuff!"
1508,"I ordered black forest cake for my sister's birthday from Angels in my Kitchen. It was fresh n soft and looks very beautiful. I really like the taste, packaging and service. So overall my experience was good and I recommend this place for sure."
1508,"Nice preparation and delivery on time.ordered multiple times in the office parties and found it fresh and yummy. chocolate cake, fruit cake or red velvet are my favourites"
908,"Awesome dhamaka alu...must try. I have been eating this dish since many years. Best dish. ........,rest of the food also good. Do try dhamaka aloo"
908,Very less options for food. Normal ambience. Less noisy. Though staff is very humble and friendly.
908,This is a small restaurant and bar situated in nfc market Interior are ok Ambknece is nice Staff is very courteous Food menu is normal nothing extraordinary And foos is good in taste
908,"No no no ! I had heard that the food is really good but had never ventured inside. Being brave enough- I ordered Dal Makhani, Paneer fish and bread one day !!! The 1 star is good enough to describe how the food was !"
908,"It's a nice place if u r finding space to have words with someone while having food, food is gud friendly staff but music would play on TVüì∫üòâ"
312902,Best place for Saturday nights
312902,This place is so happening and lively
18471283,Only for health calories conscious people. Although the place is good. The location is very prime in NFC. Ate fish and chicken platters but couldn‚Äôt finish due to their taste. Good for gym and bodybuilding people but not for everyone. Although they have two menus. The other doesn‚Äôt entertain Zomato Gold.
18471283,A very good option for people with taste buds for healthy food....do try the fresh fruit juices here. I ordered watermelon juice and a platter including Russian salad. Go and visit this place
18471283,"Food quality and taste was not at all as per the price paid. They are charging more in the name of being healthy whereby the flavor is 100% missing in the food. There are so many other places which are more genuine in terms of quality of the food. Also, quantity could have been better. Forgot to click pics of two other dishes."
18471283,"With healthy food as their mantra, hwealth cafe specialises in delicious guilt free food. In absence of sugar, refined flour and any other nutrient deficient ingredients, they prepare hearty meals that are Savory as well as refreshing.  Tried the blueberry smoothie bowl, loved it. Had the yoghurt flavor and topped with dry fruits and mixed with blueberry in the mix. The bruschetta platter was good and served in two veg variants. The Chettinad full protein meal had nicely cooked brown rice, herbed and full of veggies. The chicken was succulent.  Overall the food was delicious and didn't have any average ingredient in the mix. The decor is lively and the seating is comfortable. Service is good. I had a great time dining here."
18471283,"One of the most unmanaged outlet I have visited in the recent times. The place adorns the cap of healthy eating like many other trending cafes in the vicinity. But, the place has opened with possibly little or no trials done. We ordered for two juices, mine was a vegetable one and had too much salt added in it. I had to return the same and the replacement was equally salty. A plate of nachos served to us was full of red chilli and raw. I have had healthy nachos options at places and this was nothing like it. We returned the entire plate of nachos as my fellow diner could not stop coughing on raw red chilli in uncooked nachos and we were still charged the same. Overall: Food: 1 Beverage: 2 (pineapple juice was still okay) Service: 1 Ambience: 3"
18424893,The delivery time needs a ton load of improvement... i‚Äôve accepted that they‚Äôll take an hour and i usually plan as per... this time it took them an hour 50 mins to deliver the food... who wants to wait hungrily for 2 hours???
18424893,"Decent packaging! Normal sushi, nothing out of the ordinary. I had sushi for the first time 10 years ago in their Saket Outlet, at the time i was stunned but now that I have eaten in a lot of places it seems very ordinary.  The fish was fresh, the rice wasn‚Äôt and the food took forever to come ( an hour and fifteen minutes); it was delivered by Sushiya executives. Yes would order again for casual sushi provided that the delivery time is improved upon.  Tried: Sushi Box (8pcs)  Food: 3/5 Packaging: 3/5 Delivery Experience: 3/5"
18424893,It doesn‚Äôt get better than this.  We order quite often from here but today the texture And everything else was perfect.  Would be ordering again for sure
18424893,"Fake people, they will deduct the amount of money and not place the order, they are cheater, don't order from zomato, use swiggy or others ...."
18424893,they didn't deliver the food...my money didn't come yet
7873,I ordered some breads from Novelty restaurant at 2:40pm and kept following up. It took them almost 2 hours to deliver it at 4:35pm and the food was all stale and cold. Had to throw it all as it was too rubbery by then. They kept briefing me from past 50min that ETA is 5min. Worst service and food. Not at all satisfied. Not recommended.
7873,Love its food and flavours
18025100,Good well done
7873,Had a meal ordered from this place for lunch today in offc...kadhai paneer and 3 butter rotis meal it was...qty of paneer was a bit less as it should be for the breads that came with the meal...taste was fine though
18037834,Black current cup cake. Too good to eat. It is very yummy and tasty. Excellent topping to attract people. It is very sweet. Also very heavy and fulfilling. ¬†Wonderful location with attractive crowd.
18037834,"Having tasted the cakes and chocolate treats, I haven't found anything better than this. Blueberry Cheese Cake made by iKreate is worth going for. Simply lip-smacking delicious."
18037834,"the chocolate treats are the best things that can cheer up my mood any-time!! I have ¬†got the chance to taste the chocolate cake and chocolate treats... they are awesome, specially the strawberry ones, must try. I wish them luck and i hope we keep getting such lovely treats more often in our office!"
18037834,"So far, I have had delicious Brownies & Chocolate Truffle from ikreate. The owner/baker is a colleague so we get both custom orders and free samples. The deserts melt at the tip of the tongue; the texture, taste everything is simply perfect.¬†  The only regret is that the office is always full of people and the number of treats gets severely reduced. :)"
18037834,"Awesome, fresh and home baked cakes, some may not find them very fancy looking, but simply amazing to taste.. highly recommended.. must try..!! They bake on order, and hence freshness is guaranteed."
306526,The  first thing that pops in my mind when i think about Tuptakes is perfection. They offer a variety of cupcakes and customised designs. I have ordered from them twice and am a huge fan of their customised cupcakes.
306526,"My friends got me a customised red velvet cake from here for my b'day! The cake was fabulous the designing was impeccable and the red velvet was actually delicious, which is quite a rare find. I think the cakes are a bit too expensive, but the quality is definitely par excellence"
306526,"Really nice cakes and cupcakes,tho not as many flavour options as other places but the taste is great. Also you need to place an order beforehand as they are often booked.  Thelocation given here is their old location and is closed, they now take orders only ¬†through phone or email, so it will be a waste of time following the address directions here."
306526,"Tuptakes is doing some gorgeous handcraft when it comes to cakes and the likes, well, eyes-rolling-to-the-back-of-your-head good and gorgeous. Super-cute standard designs aside, they can do 3-dimensional decorations that look amazing for the 10 seconds you can keep your hands off them, given enough lead time. The customisation is beautiful and on point because these guys will achieve in reality what you desire virtually so yes, they are great with execution.   The cupcakes make for bites that are perfectly sized for big people and little people, for big eaters and small eaters. You only need to adjust the amount of the bites you take!  For those with artistic ability and patience, you can pick out your cake art designs online with different colors and flavors and these guys will do it for you.   The confectionary may seem to be a tad bit steep in price but the finesse of the final product will leave you satisfied.  As far as the actual flavours of the cakes go, I wasn't too much in love with how my cupcakes tasted.  Red velvet, vanilla and chocolate were the three flavours I picked and they were delicious, yes but I wish they were more rich and decadent. Anyway I am not complaining much, I absolutely love how they look.   Cost for 6 customised cupcakes is Rs 1800 and the rest of the prices vary!   Will I order again? Yes."
306526,Ordered cupcakes for a friend's 25th Birthday and couldn't have been happier. Tuptakes themselves suggested options for customization and suggested to do both fondant and non fondant ones. They were really made to our heart's glory!  They are very professional and will tel you before hand if they're too occupied to do your order.
1530,"Recently I ordered a Thali from this restaurant and got the perfect meal for one person. The best part was about the portion size, every item was enough for one person. The restaurant is best in taste and especially quantity."
1530,"On my recent visit to New Friends Colony, we checked out Bhoj restaurant for a healthy light weight food. We ordered the following: 1. Tandoori Chicken Momos: As tasty as they look they were surprisingly very tasty. The stuffing was nice and served super hot with two dips which were equally tasty. 2. Sarso ka Saag with Makke ki Roti: I absolutely loved the Saag and makka roti served with raita. It truly gave a homely vibe and I was fully satisfied with the quality of food served. Rating-4/5"
1530,"I visited here today , Restaurant is okay but the food is not up to tha mark, the price is little bit on exoent side but all other things are good . Tried some rolls and their tandoori items. Average quality with average hygiene."
1530,"Good on the go restaurant.¬† Their thali used to be good.¬† In winter do try their sarson Ka Saag with Makka ki Roti, served with butter jaggery.¬† Demerit is seating."
1530,"I have been there many times with my family ..There Dal fry tadka,shahi paneer,tandoori momos & paneer tikka was just awesome.. Recently I have tried there kadhai chicken which was not so good in taste but ya it's a lovely place with reasonable price..Must try!!"
18208912,"Whenever I visited delhi, never forgets to order from Casa Asia from last 3 years this place is have special place in my hearts, Been here 12-13 times but¬† satisfied with the service I‚Äôve got.¬†¬† Food 8/10"
18208912,"Casa Asia is takeaway/delivery restaurant. Their service is quick and efficient, although by the time any food is delivered, it gets soggy and cold so it is hard to¬† judge.  Their chilly crispy potatoes were done to perfection. Vegetable munchurian was pretty tasty. Vegetarian noodles and fried rice were fairly standard. This place is cheap and offers pretty good value for money."
18208912,"I ordered ages back, and I realise I should have reviewed earlier. Well, this place has the best dumplings I've had in a long, long time. I also ordered some spring rolls, and some chilli chicken and noodles. Very basic order because we had very little time to eat. Nonetheless, its the simple stuff that does the job, and boy did I have a great meal. Keep it up :)"
18489497,Good
18219545,"The best place in Delhi for salads and sandwiches. The blackened chicken salad with peach and avocado is my absolute favourite, closely followed by the orange almond chicken salad. The fruit bowl is delicious and the Chipotle chicken baguette sandwich is insanely good. Black, green, white, red... spectacular juices. I could eat this everyday. I order a lot from here and everything is always fresh."
18219545,"I have mostly ordered deliveries from here, and Salad days has become almost a weekly staple for me. Consistently excellent food across the board."
256,Very delicious pizza
256,Everything was delicious
256,Good coffe
18128883,"A wonderful place for the people who are into indoor games with an amazing cuisine or food . They have indoor and outdoor sitting. If you are a person who loves to sit in greenery , then you can opt for the outdoor sitting. Family-friendly place. (Everything for everyone)  I visited there twice. First time we ordered Margherita Pizza , Honey Chilli Potatoes and Penne Arabiatta.  everything was amazing. The next time we ordered Loaded nachos and they were drool worthy!!"
18128883,"I visited on the day of christmas during lunch time and it was quite crowded ,i bit confused as it was my first visit but mgr on duty helped me with table and guided me of all games activity there . I enjoyed a lot as i find true gesture of hospitality there.   Will visit again."
18128883,"Been a regular here for around 2 years used to recommend this place over tasty pizzas,pastas and sandwiches but now the food quality has taken a big downfall. Went there this Sunday with my friends. It took 45 Minutes for the food to come out quality of food was not anywhere close to what It used to be. The pizza was burnt and tasteless pasta was dry,undercooked,bland and worst. Totally waste of money disappointed to have lost such a lovely place not gonna come back again!"
3043,Price is high but quality is good and taste is very good over all üëå
3043,Don‚Äôt even know what is chilly chicken complete waste
18425159,"Warning: This place will make you super nostalgic and will immediately remind you of your recent beach vacation. The ambience is too good, it gives out such such cool and breezy vibes.   Talking about the food, they served me a mango flavored nariyal pani in my personalised nariyal ( I brought that nariyal home after all it has my name on it) The unusual mash-up made up for a good refreshing drink.  Next I tried their Malay Laksa soup and IT IS A MUST TRY. I won't lie here but I haven't had a better soup. It was coconut shell licking good. After that I tired their Thalaivaa Super Food Salad, healthy and pretty looking salad delighted my tatse buds.  Next, I ordered veg and chicken vada paos, the veg one was too dry but the chicken one made up for a good starter.   For the mains I had Kodi koora with Malabari Parantha and Appam. The kodi curry was high on flavours and tasted better with Appam instead of the usual pairing of Malabar Parantha.  I also tried their Mutton Biryani, it was served in a coconut shell and was really good.   I ended my meal on a sweet note with their Murgan Chocolate Bomb, loaded with nuts. The dessert was good but the coconut played a spoilsport here, the coconut proved that in the end it's a coconut.   Do try the Malay Laksa Soup!!  If you're a coconut lover then this is your heaven and if not then get ready to become a fan of coconut.  When you're here at this cafe, you just can't miss out on coconut."
18425159,"Goan, Andhra, Seafood and Semi asian, any cuisine craving, you should definitely consider going to this place again and again.  Located in the crowded market of Adchini, it doesn't catch your eye immediately because of the 3rd floor location and tiny boards but once you enter, you'll want to try each and every dish on their menu.  We ordered the following-  Paan Flavoured Nariyal Paani- An exciting twist to the regular coconut water, though the paan flavour was too much but it was worth a try.  Malay Laksa soup- Probably the best coconut base soup I've ever had with four different kinds of toppings in various bowls and packed with flavour, a must must order.  Chicken Cafreal- The classic goan chicken with little bit of coconut touch and amazing chicken pieces.  Fish Koliwada- The Maharastrian style fish and chips, not too spicy not too bland which goes perfectly with thr chutney.  Appam Stew Chicken- The appams are perfectly cooked and the stew is outstanding too but the chicken could've been more flavourful.  Classic Goan Prawn Curry- A safe bet wherever you go and here also it didn't disappoint at all with a small quantity of rice served with the goan curry.  Take whoever you want to take along or go alone, but whenever next you're in the mood for soutbern food, go here and I can guarantee you'll want to keep coming."
18425159,"I came here after reading a lot of good reviews about this place but it was totally a disappointment leave for the ambience and decor. Staff is so rude here and the food is really really bad. My bad, i came here for a date. We started with laksa soup. It wasn't sered hot, it was barely luke warm. Taste was also so so. We thought starters, main course and desserts wouod be good but as our meal progressed, ultimately we found out that this soup was the tastiest of all."
18425159,"If you love to try something new, this is the place to be. Continental, sea food and deserts are just amazing. Few must tries at this place are Fried Idly, Thalassa Salad, Caramel Ice cream and Malaylaksha.  Theme of the Restro is quite different than day to day restaurants. Really liked the concept arrangements."
18425159,"Nariyal Cafe is located in Adhchini and can be easily located. The ambience is easy breezy, cool and almost takes you back to your beachy vacation.  I loved how they worked on my obsession with coconuts because everything was served in coconuts (the name makes it quite obvious)  The manner in which dishes were presented and prepared was really good. I loved how they give personalised coconuts to serve coconut water in. It makes for a good souvenir to take back home!  The peach and mango coconut water was a refreshing welcome. I started of with their special: Malay laksa soup which was simply too good.  I forgot the name of the Salad I had here but it was really good. Their Vada pao was a little bit of a let down. It was too dry. The Chicken pao however, was really yummy. Would recommend it. The mains had Kodi koora, Appam, Malabari parantha and Mutton biryani. The presentation of the meal was decent but the food was absolutely delicious.  The kodi koora tasted better with appam than with the malabari parantha. The dessert I ordered was the Chocolate dome which had a coconut surprise inside. It was loaded with chocolate syrup and dry fruits.  Would love to visit again. Keep up the good work, team."
309448,"Serves a good variety of veg and non veg snacks - panner tikka and Chicken tikka was good , you will not be dissatisfied with your meals - even main course it good ."
309448,"So yesterday I ordered a non veg meal from Here !! ( chicken tandoori meal ) in which you have dal makhni , choice of bread , tandoori chicken 2 pieces and 1 sweet !! Quantity is good for a person but the food didn‚Äôt taste as expected !! Tandoori chicken was okayish !! But I didn‚Äôt like dal makhni al all !!"
309448,"For that mughlai craving and a flavourful journey to the land of tikkas, order from here and you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Butter chicken, dal makahni and tikkas - must try."
309448,good food. but chicken need to be more juicy. that's why I gave 4star.
309448,"Absolutely love your food quality and taste. I have an eco friendly suggestion. I think you should look at changing your packaging from plastic to silver foil and replace plastic spoon with wooden spoon. You can check the ones used by Dominos for packing their pasta. We all know plastic when combined with hot food becomes cancerous and disposing plastic is not possible. Hence, its a sincere suggestion to look at alternatives for packing food instead of using plastic plates. Hope you will work on this suggestion. Overall, your food is awesome!"
175,I am in love with Everything on the menu ü§§
175,I really love mac aloo tikki and it's  pocket friendly. The fries are equally amazing. Mac Puff is my personal favourite thing from McDonald's. The staff is really polite and they have decent seating area.
175,The mcveggie burger is so delicious and specially i use to have this with tandoori Mayo and lots of online would like to thank to Parvesh crew and Vinod manager who is working in saket Pvr new delhi store and i just love the hospitality-gesture from them...
175,"Went out w my friends.  We were so hungry that we ordered this much food and it was so good, very fresh quality my fav mcdonalds in delhi"
311161,Jai BIHAR üòä
311161,Worst mutton I ever had... totally waste of money
311161,"On a chilling saturday afternoon, when you live 1000 kms from your home and you crave for a home cooked mutton curry and litti (a typical bihari combo to die for when you are a bihari), and you get it at doorstep like a wish, it makes your day!!üòäüòä Thanks Litti.in for the bhuna mutton and litti with baigan and aloo ka chokha maintaining its authentic sarson ka tel wala flavour. It's just foodgasm. Every one should try these traditional dishes even if you are not a bihari.ü§™ü§™"
310848,"I have tried this place many times , but their quality isn't that much good that it used to be.  But one thing I can say is their malai kofta is a must try food itemüíï."
310848,"Probably the beat place in malviy nagar to have north indian as well as chinese. The way they prepare dal makhni is just amazing. Spices used are in adequate amount. It is my all time favourite. And their veg platter is also good, taste wise as well as preperation wise"
310848,"Great range of mughlai and Chinese offered in a small place in Malviya Nagar. Love their naan breads, stuffed keema naan is my favourite. Non veg starters, especially kebabs are amazing. The main courses are served in good quantity. We always end up getting the leftovers packed. Though they charge extra for leftover packing. So it's best for larger group of people. Very pocket friendly place! Ambience could be much better. Service is fast and quite good."
305871,"Tibetan style chicken momos & chicken lollypop, ordered for the first time. The taste is spiced up with juicy hit in it. Momos were well cooked with the juices intact. Chicken lollypop had a thin crispy cover and did taste awesome."
18303837,awesome
305871,I didn‚Äôt liked the ice tea
305871,Very Very Very Bad Food..... they don't know how to cook and my money was a complete waste. their food is not even worth 10/- street food
305871,the food was less for an half
209,"Pizza was delivered late with no seal , tissues @ chilli flakes @ oregano @ when called up the person was so rude on call .. horrible service"
209,"The are spreading corona virus to there customer's. Please don't buy anything from them,............"
209,Fast delivery
209,"When we ask for cheeseburst we usually expect them to be stuffed with cheese, right? But the new pizzas that they have come up are really bad. I ordered achari do pyaaza in cheese burst. Although delivery was on time. The taste was bad. This is not a flavour you come out with for a pizza."
209,"Worst worst worst place with the rudest people possible  Ridiculous service , super arrogant and mindless staff. They think customers are idiots . After placing the order through Zomato , they call and say we will send your order if you can wait for One and a half hour or we will cancel .  And then for another half hour  they did not even cancel it and hence I could not place any other order .  On the other hand they told me I was stupid to give and order from Zomato , Instead a dominos order should be given via dominos app only .  Complete idiots run this place ."
17977751,The place is decent. We went for the dinner. They have very good place for candle light dinners. We ordered non veg platter and paneer tikka. The place is awesome.
17977751,Food was ok.Manager was wonderful but place was quite dull .As per manager place was booked for a party at late night so there was nobody in restaurant .we landed around 8 pm and we stayed till 11.30 but couldn see a single bird there.was quite surprising. food and hospitality-4/5 outdoor-5/5
17977751,Went for a party Great place for a part of 100-150 people  Quite spacious  Snacks and main course were good Sangria was not upto the mark Mojito was good
17977751,Good place . Love the open tables they have . And they give you good delicious food which makes you go to this place again n again . They just need a little better sound system .
17977751,Bad place .. worst food... never make an attempt to go .. wasted time and money .. will never suggest any one to go there. The service was pooor and and it was an below average place to party
582,"I booked hall for birthday celebrations and it was awesome in all aspects.. Food taste, ambience and service."
582,I celebrated my daughter's first b day. 40 people gathering. Awsome food taste n arrangement done by goverdhan manager mr david. His hospitality was great. His arrangement for b day was vry nice. I strongly recommend the others.
582,Last night i visited govardhan vegetarian at Adchini .this is pure vegetarian ..ambiance is very well .. Food very testy i ordered plater paneer tikka very testy ...
18233599,Chocolate avalange and the chocolate fondue are the one of the best desserts that i have had and on their menu. Have tried most of their menu. Its one of my favourite place ‚ô•Ô∏è
18233599,"Had pizza, white sauce pasta with virgin mojito and cold coffee. Specially the cold coffee was amazing. There thin crust pizza is just amazing and white sauce pasta had perfect blend and perfect Italian taste."
18233599,"Amazing place , I tried chocolate lava , nutella  waffle with ice cream and expresso . Would definitely try more ."
302381,"I have ordered fried chicken and non veg platter, when received the packaging was not by pind balluchi branding but i ignored and decided to go ahead on food. Here comes the pathetic food - pieces of chicken has only bone nothing else that too was super oily and burnt. This is a fake pind balluchi. I have raised a complaint with zomato but they also have not replaced the order though i didn't wish to have the same but they have also not refunded my amount. Zomato is currently providing only chat support and they are not providing any refund or replacement. It was a total waste of money and a worst zomato ordering experience."

6200,Rustique is a must visit  My rating- 5/5 Ambience- 5/5 Must go place for couples.
6200,This is one of my favs place and love to visit as it has such lovely ambience and outdoor beauty. Food is amazing and must recommended to visit the place
6200,"Had some amazing and fun time with friends at essex it is an amazing place for dine in. They have varieties of food and drinks in menu. The outlet is having amazing ambience and perfect staff and service is quick and nice. We tried mutton chops , drums of heaven, french fries, pizza in starters and dal Makhani, mutton rara with assorted breads in main course. They were sizzling yummy and mouthwatering. The dishes were well cooked and presented. The chicken were delicious and tasty. Really liked it. Highly recommend this place for amazing food and service."
6200,Essex Village is an amazing outlet for hangout with your love ones. They have varieties in menu and amazing place for seating with warming ambience.  I tried some lip smacking dishes here like ‚ñ™Ô∏èIn starters : ‚ñ´Ô∏èMutton Chops which were delicious and tasty  ‚ñ´Ô∏èDrums of Heaven were nice and awesome. They were sizzling.  ‚ñ´Ô∏èFrench fries were crispy and has perfect texture  ‚ñ´Ô∏è Pizza were full of veggies and overloaded cheese. They really put good amount of cheese on it and base was good.  ‚ñ´Ô∏èSpring Roll has nice stuffing and outer layer is crisped and has perfect texture. ‚ñ™Ô∏èIn main course : ‚ñ´Ô∏èMutton Rara  it was delicious and bit spicy.  ‚ñ´Ô∏è Butter Chicken has nice gravy and texture. It really has proper consistency and creamy texture.  ‚ñ´Ô∏èAssorted Breads  they were warm and soft.  ‚ñ™Ô∏è In Dessert : ‚ñ´Ô∏èRas Malai  : it was delicious and tasty. The ras malai was soft and sponge. It has good amount of sweetness in it.  ‚ñ´Ô∏èHeaven surprise was delicious and tasty.  All the food was delicious and well cooked. The presentation was nice and awesome. The chicken and mutton was succlent. The starters and bread were amazing. The service was quick and fast. The place is amazing.
6200,"Last month I went this cafe with my friends for brunch.Its a beautiful place with huge sitting place and I just love the ambience.They have sitting space inside and outside both.Coming to the food ,I had chicken strips with bell pepper pizza, Arrabbiata fettuccini and spring rolls,food is average though.Dessert options were less but red velvet cake and Cream caramel is delicious treat."
18446475,Sirka pyaaz of this restaurant I just love it ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
18446475,I ordered for a chicken thali .. they served me veg thali instead.. Tried calling the restaurant several times but no one answered. Disappointed
18446475,Bad food. Had to vomit. Old meat too.
18446475,"Dilli bc has been my go to option for whenever i crave a good north indian meal. They prepare the food with so much love that you can tell it in the taste. This time i tried out the malviya nagar outlet as it was the nearest to us at that moment and oh damn, what good mutton seekh kebabs they served. Succulent, juicy mutton seekhs were just amazing. Chicken seekh were equally good. The portion sizes are quite fulfilling. Also, in main course, do try the dilli bc butter chicken. The gravy and juicy chicken are surely worth trying."
18446475,"No matter which part of delhi-ncr i am in, dilli bc has been my go to option for a good north indian meal and trust me they never dissapoint. I love the vegetarian here as much as i love the non vegetarian. Tandoori chicken, perfectly marinated and roasted is surely not worth missing. When it comes to veg, try the dilli bc special paneer tikka and soya chaap tikka. They truly do justice to north indian food. The portion sizesnare equally good. So do try them out!"
310312,Really poor quality of food. Atleast you guys should use fresh chicken Amritsari chicken maggie sucks Chicken surprise burger highly disappointing
310312,Heard alot about the joint n was totally disgraced by the service provided by them as bun was not able to hold the burger n patty was not as fresh. Its an ordinary simple joint and a place to satisfy ur hunger not ur tastebuds
310312,"Ordered 4 shakes from the outlet - 1 strawberry, 2 KitKat, 1 oreo. Only 3 were delivered after which the restaurant became 'unresponsive' and zomato refunded us the the cost of the shake. The three that came were, pathetic. Watery, tasteless and mostly consisting of ice. Horrible, horrible Shakes. I'd advise everyone to stay away."
310312,"Ordered simple burgers, burger buns were very hard and almost non-chewable. The patties were over fried which made them tasteless. Rest sauces and vegetables couldn't save the burger  Overall, they weren't even value for money spent on them."
310312,"I had ordered seekh Maggi , chicken nuggets and spicy chicken burger. Delivery was before time. Packing was decent and the taste was overall good but the quantity of nuggets could have been more. Overall a good experience from Papi paet.."
18241531,Situated in G.K 1 M block market . Quite place with good food. Their murg Malai tikka was amazing. Funky ambience and good servers. We ordered one mushroom starter which was totally a show stopper.
18241531,"The staff was courteous and helpful. But they don't serve any drinks as there is some issue, as was told to us. Moreover, on Zomato Gold, it showed us 2+2 on drinks, but thanks to no drinks, there's no offer to avail of. The restaurant should have updated its current status on Zomato."
18241531,"I organised a party for around 100 people.And following food items selected for preparation for guests : Veg starters* Paneer Tikka* French Fries* Honey Chilli PotatoNon-veg starters* BBQ wings* Crispy Sesame Chicken* Chicken TikkaVeg Main Course* Shahi Paneer* Dal Makhani* Roasted Vegetable PizzaNon Veg Main Course* Roasted Chicken Pizza* Butter Chicken* Chilli Chicken GravyAssorted Breads* Plain Tandoori Roti/ Plain Naan/ Butter Naan/ Tandoori Parantha/ Laccha ParanthaRice* Veg Fried RiceDessert* Brownie with ice creamDrinks* Atleast 3-4 Mocktail.* Other Carbonated Drinks These guys forgot the prepare the Veg main course. And the reason given - ‚Äútheir management had not opened the screenshots sent by their CEO correctly, they just checked the preview and since in the preview of the picture veg main course was not mentioned so they did not prepare it. Our agony didnt stop there. Being in the hospitality industry, these guys didnt have simmer nor any equipments to keep the warm (that fuel thiny, i dont know what its called). Anywasy they didnt have and because of which food got cold soggy and when we told them about this, they were like ‚ÄúAadhey ghantey se khana laga rakha hai‚Äù With a audience of around 100 people its really hard to push all of the guests together for the lunch, some were dancing, some were chit chatting, some were clicking pictures, etc. So we cannot expect the guests to listen to the host obediently. Anyways, towards the end they ran out of food. I had given them a confirmation of around 95 people and i think food for 50 people was also not prepared. The veg fried rice got converted to steam rice. The brownie with ice cream that he promised was never given, they just gave plain vanilla ice cream and that too after 4-5 bricks, they were like we dont have more ice creams. Daal makhni was in less quantity which was served to around 30-40 people only. The veg pizza was not given at all. Instead they said that they will provide something else, some veggies with gravy and shit. They even ran out of frech fries and gave us potato wedges in its place. Before the deal got finalised the guy with whom I was coordinating was really polite ( i dont want to bring the name of the person, i dont want to bash a person directly, so let‚Äôs call him Mr. X) and as when we proceeded towards the end he got infuriated, started reminding the ‚Äúso-called‚Äú terms we agreed upon. I had requested him to start by 11 AM. My team member reached there at 10.45 AM and these guys were not ready with anything. The chairs were not kept properly, cleaning had not been done, lighting was properly done, basically nothing was done. My team member himself aligned the chairs with their staff and pretty much helped them in managing everything. And Mr. X reminded us of the time. They ran out of the food and when they took more time in serving they refused to serve the food to the host, and said that according to the terms , the time limit has exceeded so we cannot serve the food. Now tell me guys, when the host is taking care of all the guests, how is he supposed to eat between all this? and that too when these guys are running out of each and every food item that they promised to give.On top of all this, there was no one for clearing the dirty tables, no one was there at the water counter to serve water to the guests. It was only when we told them please put your team to work and asked them to take care of the guests, then only they were convinced ‚Äúoh yes, we need some one for that‚Äù such heads, i tell you. I will never recommend this place to any one in my life. I wish this closes down because not only the owners are bringing disrepute to themselves, they‚Äôre also not giving a good experience to their guests.SO GUYS, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TO ‚ÄúNEVER GO THERE‚ÄùThat‚Äôs all!"
18241531,Have been to this place quite a few times and everytime I‚Äôve had fabulous experiences. Their setup on terrace is a must-must during winters.
18241531,"The interior was good and I loved it..the service was good and quick but the pizza was not up to mark.. I ordered veggie pizza but there was only capsicum in name of vegetable, that was the bad part.. the taste was very normal.. All over a good experience..‚ò∫Ô∏è"
18312632,"I am not a big fan of asian food but on being forced by my friends I went here yesterday. But the experience turned out to be good, the food was pretty authentic and really tasty. I personally loved pad thai noodles."
18312632,Pan asian restaurant  Food 3/5 Ambience 4/5 Staff 4.5/5 Overall 4/5 I have visited many pan asian restraunt but this was a authentic one whereas many people wont understand the concept
18312632,"First time ordering from Pho King. Food was delivered on time and packaged very well, especially the tacos and their stuffing. The stuffing was spicy and in good quantity. The burrito was tasty. Overall, all the items were tasty and the quality was great."
18312632,A very small restaurant ....nice decor ...service needs stepping up ...food is superbly average...totally disappointed with Asian food : there are better options to eat ! Overrated by Zomato endorsers!
18312632,"Ordered second time as the food is very nice, however, there is one criticism which we faced last time around as well. They do not send any sauces along with the order which is a must especially in pan Asian and chinese food.  They have a very nice dried garlic and a red sauce which i made them deliver in my last order as they had not sent. That time also.  This time agaib i got no sauces and I just kind of gave up and ate my food as it is.  Please upgrade your home delivery services as i will only order your food one last time. And in case its still the same then you would have lost me as a customer for good.  Atul Aggarwal"
18271497,"Few days back I went to this cute little bakery with a friend and we had a really good time. There were a lot of options to choose from,so we had a few pastries and a cake. I loved how polite the staff lady was. She helped us choosing the best ones for us. So we had a rainbow pastry, and a black forest pastry. We also took a cute heart shaped cake. The products were fresh and delicious. The bakery has a very cosy ambience perfect for a date with your loved one."
18271497,Black forest pastry. Here the beauty is the vanilla cream mixed inside the cake with choco chips which gives a wonderful taste. Very heavy and fulfilling.
18271497,The delivery service of the restaurant is absolute crap. I had ordered a brownie at 11:30 with a delivery estimate of 25-35 mins and they never delivered. The mobile phone was switched off and the landline was never answered. Really shitty service. Even at 12:55 it showed estimated delivery at 12:31 am!
18271497,"Visit to Dezertfox was about craving for something sweet and trying a new place. Lucky for us, we spotted this place.¬† Being on the main road gives the place visibility but at the same time, parking is an issue. It is a small and cozy outlet and it was really quiet, the evening we visited.¬† There was a small sitting area which we thought of occupying quickly.¬† Once we started to have a glance at the food items and the menu, everything looked so tempting. We couldn‚Äôt resist and ate a lot.¬† We tried Jars, cupcakes, macrons (though I‚Äôm not a fan, but these were decent), truffle and brownies. Everything was fresh and tasted really flavorsome.¬† While we were enjoying our desserts we noticed Gift Baskets/ Platters etc available at the store and took photographs of those as well. This is a decent place to fulfill your sweet craving."
18271497,It's a small outlet but have a lot of options to choose from. I tried their cheesecake and dark truffle. Cheesecake was delicious and dark truffle was also good. Do try it out!!
309820,They are serving expired wild water very disappointing
309820,"I had heard a lot about doner grill and this place was highly recommended by a friend so I decided to place a delivery order. First it took the restaurant valet 2 hours to deliver to my address, I had to repeatedly call the restaurant and valet to get my food. By the time the food arrived I had already eaten dinner as I couldn‚Äôt have waited till 11:15 to eat my food. The valet upon reaching didn‚Äôt ring my bell and instead kept waiting outside delaying the delivery further. And he was rude to add. I finally tasted the falafel roll combinations I had ordered - and they were dry and not tasty. I‚Äôm never ordering from doner grill again.  SINCERELY, An avid foodie and zomato user and a disappointed customer"
309820,The quality and quantity of cuisine is outstanding. Everything is additionally awsome. I asked for a chicken teriyaki doner with a cat shake unit. Chicken Teriyaki is an Asian food and packed with doner as a mix of Lebanon and Asia. I'm a nice worker. It tasted incredibly good.
309820,"You shouldn't name your food just to sell it. I ordered ""Fat fries"" which were normal fries from mccain"
18034050,"Elation is quite a well known cafe at GK1 M Block Market.  I have been here only once post midnight, and have tried only their sheesha. So, for the same reason cannot comment on their food. However, the sheesha was great.  Coming to the vibe of this place, it has an indoor sitting as well as an outdoor sitting.   Well known for the live music played here during the weekend nights, it is usually quite full on fridays and saturdays."
18034050,A nice place to catch up when you are shopping in gk
18034050,The food was crispy and tasty. The white sauce pasta was delicious and a must try. The cold Coffee was also good. There are some games too. In short this is a good hangout place with your friends.
1902,The place was smelling of Italian food early in the morning even when there was no one was eating any food cos we were the only ones there having a 2cups of coffee . Now considering the price this restuarant charges for th le coffee the least they can do is have the restuarant interiors smelling clean and fresh atleast in the morning....
1902,"Best place for coffee, cake and conversation! The bookstore is another reason to visit this place. My personal favourite hangout place in Khan market when meeting a friend to catch up. Do try their lemon curd cake."
1902,"Ordered dessert from cafe turtle as their chocolate cake and carrot cake was an old time favourite. The cakes smelled of cardboard, another place that uses bad quality packaging :("
1902,"I absolutely love the Freshly Whisked Pankcakes from Cafe Turtle. Was craving them today, but the pancakes I got were sour (maybe the batter was problematic). This is one-off as otherwise, the food is great."
1902,"One of my favourite place to eat and drink, when I wish to have healthy food. Excellent juices ranging from detox juice to fountain of youth. Good food made from whole wheat breads and generally roasted fillings. Ambience is also a cosy one. Prices are generally on a bit of a higher end because of everything healthy and organic."
300007,"Highly unprofessional. Very clearly, and repeatedly advised, not to put cabbage in any form in our food order, yet they put cabbage, risking the allergic conditions of my guests from Canada. It could have been disastrous, a nightmare, and a medical condition but it was noticed in time. The restaurant manager, Krishna and Bikram, admitted the lapse and apologized but that's not enough. And the food was bad, bad and bad, no taste, not an iota of what Chinese food ought to be. Never ever again, this is purely a commercial venture, with no idea what Chinese food is. Bad bad experience."
300007,"Ordered yam samrot kai salad , the quality nd quanity is way less as compared to what we ate at the restaurant, hardly and chunks of pineapple, dressing is super strong as well chicken pieces at the restaurant were such big chunks , would request to keep the standard same as how you serve at the restaurant"
300007,"Good food, good ambience. Have been to a couple of outlets but the food quality and taste is same and authentic at all. Will recommend it always."
300007,One of the best Pan Asian/Chinese chains in New Delhi. They‚Äôve really maintained their quality since inception. Great ambience and food makes Side Wok worth the price for sure.
300007,"I used to be regular at Side Wok Khan market few years back. The food there was excellent and along with great ambience it was my regular joint for dinner. I stopped visiting after few bad experiences with there GK outlet.  So after a gap of over 2 years visited them again in the GK outlet, the service provided was great. The food was also good though not as good as it used to be. I will visit them again as there haka Noodles are one of the best in the market. However chicken dishes need some improvement. Overall not a bad experience."
18363391,A quite dine in place. Had crispy waffles here which were served with vanilla and chocolate ice cream. Great taste! Their veg cheese burger was above average but not great.
18363391,"An absolutely fabulous all week brunch food place in N block market, depot 48 has something for every palate. The menu has a Mexican vibe- they have a nice selection of quesadillas and a variety of guacamole recipes on the menu. But for the classic brunch loving foodies, they have a variety of fabulous waffles on the menu! We‚Äôve even ordered for delivery from here and while the waffles do become a little soggy, they are still fun to eat!"
18363391,"Fun and quirky decor, nice live performances and good food. The waffles are absolutely phenomenal (especially the classic and the chocolate gianduja ones) and cannot be missed!"
18363391,Visited this place last year in April! N yes I had one of the best Mexican food and their guacamole was out of the world. Loved their truffle oil fries.. and their drinks were also very good! And as far as i remember they had live music with a gal called Natasha singing fabulous and whole crowd was cheering for her!
18363391,"Definitely one of the most underrated places in Delhi. The food is great, music / vibe is always nice and staff is friendly. Banana toffee waffles have to be one of the best desserts available in Delhi. The guacamole trio is a must try. Would also recommend the vegetarian quesadillas"
18456764,"One of my favourite place for takeout Asian food. love their karate kitchen chilli chicken. hygenic packaging, their bags are very handy"
18456764,"Horrible service, would rate them 0 if I had the option. The delivery is so so bad, its just not worth it. They don't even answer the phone so there's no way to contact them. Don't recommend at all."
18456764,Zomato and Karate Kitchen both failed to deliver my food. I was informed after the order was accepted and ready that nobody was going to deliver my food. Karate Kitchen‚Äôs staff was extremely unhelpful and perfectly happy to let the prepped food sit there wasted.
18456764,"Karate Kitchen is a home delivery brand that has set up multiple outlets across Delhi NCR, and specializes in putting their spin on traditional Asian dishes. They keep updating the menu to use more seasonal produce and introduce new dishes every now and then.   We were sent some of their dishes for tasting and the food arrived hot, on time and was neatly packed and labelled.  The Thai Style Spring Rolls had a thin and crispy filo pastry covering and were filled with fresh vegetables and cream cheese, flavored with herbs. The roll didn't feel oily at all and tasted really nice with the honey chili sauce served alongside.   The Shitake Mushrooms was a great dish for mushroom lovers as the innately flavorful shitake mushrooms were wok tossed in kaffir lime, lemongrass and galangal which imparted a lovely taste to the mushrooms.  The Chicken Gyoza had a thin covering and were nicely pan fried to get a crispy texture. The dumplings were nicely filled with minced chicken but the filling could have had a bit more flavor.     The Karate Chili Chicken consisted of boneless chicken tossed with fermented chili paste, onions & bell peppers. The flavors had nicely permeated the chicken pieces and the chicken itself was really juicy.   For main course, we went with the Pak Choi, Black Mushrooms and Bamboo Shoots in Oyster Sauce. The vegetables were tossed with aromats such as galangal and kaffir lime and stir-fried. The vegetables were cooked in a thick, flavorsome oyster sauce.   The Bakmi Goreng Noodles or stir-fried noodles were thin and nicely cooked and had a lovely, spicy and tangy flavor, and tasted so nice that they could be had on their own without any gravy dish.    Overall, all dishes tasted really good, and we especially liked the bakmi goreng noodles, shitake mushrooms and the pak choi and black mushrooms in oyster sauce. Definitely try this place the next time you want to order in Asian food."
18382342,"Great menu, tasty food but the packing charges are a scam. On my partner's last order, we had to pay 375 just for packing, and most of the packing material was not even eco friendly. Don't feel inclined to order from here again."
18382342,best place for sushi.. really taste..love them.. the Asian food here is just too good.
18382342,"Update on the previous review where I had given them 5 stars. As visible from the photo, the packaging was horrendous for the noodle bowl. Last time it arrived in a plastic container but it's unfair to charge such high packaging charges and just dump the noodles into the cardboard box. Funnily enough, the other items were packed properly. Please review and correct."
1056,"We are having Minar food for decades now. Standard ordering for dine in and take away is Dal Makhni any day the best in town Chicken Pakoda with bone is to die for and ofcourse butter chicken, mutton sheekh and for Vegetarians Palak Paneer"
1056,This place has been there for almost ever ... I have been going to this and ordering from this place since childhood ... I love the Brain masala and the mutton curry ... Im not a big fan of the vegetation stuff the place offers... It's a nice restaurant to eat out with your family and relatives ... The ambience of the place are just about fine like any other nice restaurant would have .... The staff is also very experienced .... The location is good central for anybody to visit in Delhi ... It would not be unfair to say that it's a little overpriced ....
1056,"I had ordered butter chicken and had mentioned in kitchen instructions ""Boneless and medium spicy"". None of the instructions was respected and when I had called they were so rude and was harassing over the call. I am shocked with the treatment I got from the owner of Minar. And to add on I tasted the gravy since I don't eat chicken with bones. Gravy was horrible it was full of butter and cream no other taste. Zamato also couldn't do anything as the owner was saying it's not his duty to read special instructions."
303288,This one is my favourite place to hangout with my favourites. They have both inside and outside sitting arrangements. Again my favourite place is the outsude one... It feels like you aren't in India. Beautiful view it has.. must visit for sure :D
303288,I visited Starbucks on 18.03.2020 with a friend . We ordered caramel macchiato and caramel Frappuccino . After having and leaving from Starbucks within an hour. We both felt nauseaous and puked thereafter. We didn‚Äôt have anything in between the time period . Till late evening our head was spinning and the stomach felt uneasy. Couldn‚Äôt eat properly thereafter. Please look into the matter with a rigorous attitude. Starbucks being an international brand. This kind of quality is not acceptable.
303288,I visited Starbucks at GK 1 M Block market sometime back . GK 1 M block is my favorite place n Delhi so far. the ambience is too cool. i ordered mocha frappuccino. i also got lemon cake with it . it tasted Yum . m always a fan of starbucks ..
303288,The coffee was pretty good. I tried the red velvet pie for the first time. It was good but not as good as other chocolate cakes.
3589,Mad over donuts is one of my favourite place for donuts. Whenever i use to have cravings for donuts it‚Äôs the only place gets click in mind within fraction of seconds. I am simply fond of this place and it‚Äôs donuts.  Must try.
3589,Love their donuts always. Their kitkat donut is my all time favourite. They always have got great deals for the customers. My favourite place to have donuts from
311671,"Quality of food: 3/5 Quantity of food: 4/5 Delivery service: 0/5 (they took 1 hour to deliver from GK to Saket, with no prior information and a very, very rude + unhelpful valet not telling me why my food was late. Zomato wasn't helpful either and I had to call the restaurant 4 times to ask about the food I had paid for)"
311671,"The food was delivered 2 hours later. their personal valet did not know the directions of the place despite correct address being put in. this caused even more delay. as a result, the burgers were all soggy. had to call multiple times and it wasted a lot of time. needs better customer services."
311671,"Absolutely love the quality and quantity. It‚Äôs my go to place to order from when I wanna treat myself in office. Love their classic American burger the most, with everything else that I‚Äôve tried giving  very close competition as well. üòÅ"
311671,"Very disappointed with my first experience here. Read the good reviews and ordered the Piri Piri chicken burger. Tasted nothing of piri piri. All I could taste was the supposed piri piri mayo which was on the verge of splitting. Chicken itself was overcooked and dry.  Also, who serves 6 fries with a burger? Portion sizes are tiny compared keeping in mind the price of RS.349 for one burger."
18418209,Ordered food and Nimtho and fell sick. Could taste the oil after food. Very bad quality.
18418209,"The service is horrible. They send the wrong order every time and when complained to manager, he replies , I can‚Äôt do anything. Absolutely pathetic. Never ordering again."
1215,A very casual eating place ... Perhaps it's more of a takeaway or order a meal place... The food is good and the best part is that the quality and the taste has not deteriorated in so many years as this is a fairly old place .... The Butter chicken - Mutton curry with the Parantha is a must eat from this place .... The rest of the snacky stuff and the vegetarian delights are very pretty okay .... It's a fine place to order from to break the monotony of eating from your favourite or regular place ....
1215,I ordered kebabs and chicken Tikka. The chicken was stale in the Tikka and the kebab we're stale too. They stank so much we couldn't even keep it on our table for 15 mins let alone eating it. How is this place even running? Agar mughe ya humaim se kisi ko kuch bhi hua because of this place's food. Tum Gaye. Police complain toh main dalunga hee. Case alag file karunga. Fake reviews se dukan chal rahi hai
1215,"After trying and testing i have finally found a good professional catering service. Their food is by far the best. The quality of raw materials they use makes them a class apart from others in the market. I've been getting catering done from kababs & Curries for the past few years now. Their standard of food is upto the mark. Their staff is very active and respectful. I have had no complaints. They come highly recommended. I have been getting calls from guests who have attended my party, praising the food and asking for their name and number."
1215,The food was pathetic. the chicken was smelly. Very bad taste. And very expensive. I will never order from this restaurant again.
1215,Awesome kebabs
309156,"I had ordered some pastries and enjoyed each and every bite of it. It was fresh, delicious,good quality and mouth watering. I had also ordered cakes and bakery items in the past also. And i must say it serves as it claims. I highly recommended to all my friends"
309156,"I had ordered milk bread, it was definitely overpriced. The bread was dry and tasteless also for 100Rs or more you expect a genuine quantity and quality for of bread but this was not the car. Won‚Äôt be ordering again from here"
309156,"Bread and More is my go-to bakery in Delhi because I think they definitely make the best croissants in the city. Their ham and cheese croissant, chicken quiche, chicken pot pie, and banana walnut cake are an absolute must have if you love yourself some bread. Perfect for an indulgent breakfast option with coffee if you are ordering in, their cafe is a great place to hang out as well. They also do delicious pastas. But the best part is that during this pandemic they have not only been open every single day since the lockdown started, their croissants are absolutely fresh and dreamy. Kudos to the team for doing such an excellent job during such tough times."
309156,The place has changed a lot over the years... It has turned into predominantly a bakery from a fast food joint and a confectionery... The salads and crossiants were simply amazing then .... Currently it is more of a coffee joint place to sit and chill ... The location and the ambience of the place are still pretty to sit over a coffee date ....
309156,Absolutely fresh breads.
9834,A South Delhi Indian and Mughlai eating joint which is known for its Veg and Non veg curries and not too much for its tandoori stuff.... My personal favorite is the famous Dal Shikhara and the Shahi paneer/ Paneer butter masala ... I am not a big fan of the Non veg curries for some reason but will leave it for others to decide ... Hygene appears to be compromised from the outside so can be better .....The tariffs are okay to be fair ....
9834,Small ambiance and service was fast. I went there with a friend for dinner and this place really stood up. Their winter dish fish tikka with roomali roti was outstanding in taste and yummy. Prices are pocket friendly and I will definitely be back to this place.
18279463,Iast Sunday i was visited here and ordered some food. Tomato based seafood is the bast of this hungry pistals. really i enjoyed it..thank you hungry pistals
18279463,Cajun crispy chicken burger was superb. The Cajun spice was evident but not overpowering. The chicken was well prepared. I tried the following pizzas Polo fungi  BBQ chicken Fungi e prosciutto  They all had a good topping to cheese ratio and were cooked well. The base was well prepared and not dry at all. My fav out of all of these was the polo fungi The only drawback about this place was it‚Äôs delivery time
18279463,Tomato base seafood soup. It is excellent and outstanding to take. The tomatoes are very well maced and mixed with other vegetables. The taste of the salt is absolutely perfect. Very heavy and fulfilling.
18279463,Hungry pistals is delivery outlet is night. delivery service is very poor. i order the pizza & pizza was so oily pizza base is oil taste is so bad.
18279463,The worst pizzaa had in my life i order 2 pizzaa polo funngi and bbq chicken pizzaa BBQ is too sweet and ant the base is full of oily base was oncooked seems too i never ever go back to the order with hugry pistal
9840,"Had an Wonderful dinner with family. I must say Grills & Platter By Pind Balluchi is¬† lovely place to visit for foodies. their wide selection of starters and main course is amazing, better then any other buffet concept restaurant in delhi Ncr. service is also top notch. good luck guys"
9840,"It's located on main road but they provide vallet parking ,so parking is not an issue. Visited this place on a Friday evening, and it was not much crowded as expected. Ordered few drinks on zomato gold, they provide small drinks on 2+2. To start with, in snacks we ordered bhatti bhuna murg and murgh shola Kabab. bhatti bhuna murgh was crispy, was a different version of tandoori chicken and tasted really well. Murgh shola Kabab were boneless pieces of chicken Tikka, with cheese sprinkled over them. It tasted descent. In main coarse we ordered butter chicken and chicken masala. The butter chicken gravy was thin, sweet and chicken melted well in the mouth. The best part was chicken masala, it was really well cooked with keema gravy and tasted awesome. One must try this if you visit this place. The service was not slow, and the waiters could not explain the menu to us. Drinks are bit over priced. Overall a nice experience.  Price : 2000 for two"
9840,"Was very excited to go to @Grills and Platters. Very friendly and welcoming staff. Great service from the get go. Waiters need just a little more finesse !!. Got a little too crowded with more than one group. Wonder if there are party rooms in the hotel who came for buffet downstairs etc. Ambiance may have taken a little bit of a dent with time.¬†  Multiple excellent appetizers. Golgappa water needs attention. May be a little bland. Dinner Buffet left me a little umimpressed, may be that the nature of buffet after lots of appetizers. Excellent Shahi Paneer kofta. Good Biryani. Mutton and Chicken Curry OK. Dal needs attention. The chapati and roti guy was stretched when it got busy. They needed a couple people doing that job. Was disappointed in gulab jamun. Need them to melt in the mouth. !!! was too crusty.¬† Still willing to go another time."
9840,"My family, Relative & friends visited Pamposh Grills & platters for my sons birthday.It is one of the best Place if looking for good food,and one of the best place for banquet & kitty function,there was buffet menu with more than 15 main course and live chat counter with balla papri & golgappe,Amazing starters like chilly chicken paneer tikka...... So many ,Having Piping hot soup is really stimulating the appetite , ""Wow"" Ambience and interior of the place is so good I was really impressed with the service, Over all they will really make me a special day in my life ever remembering day with fantastic experience in pind balluchi All my friends should visit this place"
18398571,great ambience and stafff..i ordered hiney chilli potaoes and a shake... both were fresh and tasty..overall loved them
18398571,Hiya foodies Today I ordered from this cafe and thr food was just delicious ü§§ü§§ü§§ I ordered - Cheesy fries which was just ü§§ü§§ü§§‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è And  Mixed sauce pasta which was also yummm ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è Both the things were tasty and i am gonna be ordering again soon‚ò∫Ô∏è You guys also try and order fast if you want to have amazing tasty delicious food ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è Deliciousness 5 on 5 ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
18398571,"I had ordered the masala chai kettle that serves three. Firstly, the restaurant delivered it in three separate cups instead of a kettle. Secondly, despite my added instruction of making it strong, the restaurant sent me bad milky tea. There was no masala in it!! Thirdly, the tea has excessive amounts of sugar. It‚Äôs too sweet to consume."
1625,A perfect place to order from if you are in mood for some desi dhaba food. The Kadhi and Aloo Naan is awesome. Rajma and Chhole ain't the best though.  I have ordered from Gupta Ji ka Dhaba over ten times now.
1625,oredered Kadhai Paneer with roti and Aloo naan. the quality of roti and aloo naan was not good and the kadhai paneer was too spicy with lot of oil. Even the ordered was not packed with Zomato Seal.
1625,ordered dal tadka with plain roti and lassi.. dal tadka was not bad taste was ok not so much spicy very disappointed with lassi gud for hostelers as it is budget friendly and taste is ok
1625,"Nice, good spot to go with family and taste the dhaba food , varities of food available with the good service . Go once to try the taste of Gupta ji food best spot for the hungry foodies."
1625,Why is this even listed on Zomato? Does this place even have required licences? Zomato should not list places which do not maintain hygiene like places without licences like FSSAI Authority Licence and Health/Trade licence.
18365388,"Ordered Chicken biryani recently. Honestly it was not good in test and delicious. It was cooked from frozen chicken. Service was quick, packaging was good, but overall experience not good to place order again."
18365388,I have ordered mutton biriyani. As mentioned in menu they serve 1kg. Ok now in 1kg biriyani you people are giving bloody 2 pcs of mutton and the size is just 1 spoon size. I don't find wasting 700 for just rice. Not ordering again.
18365388,"I have been ordering Behrouz for more than a year now. Yesterday I ordered a Queema Gosht Biryani (Regular) and the taste and quality was very very low. Actually this is the 2nd time I felt the quality being low but last night it was terrible. The masala was less, meat pieces were not cooked well and the taste was terrible.  I need someone to look into this because you will lose one of your most loyal customer if this continues."
18268360,"This cute little bakery situated in the busy Green Park market. Has very few seating, but is quite cosy especially the outdoor seating. Serves good coffee and pastries."
18268360,"Don't try this place. There are places better than this. Their servicing is slow. I have tried four items: 1. Non veg English breakfast: The potato wedges were good and so was the omelette. But bread wasn't toasted. I liked the jam (strawberry) overall it was good. 2. Veg french breakfast: don't try it. Not worth it. The fruit bowl anyone can make at home. Just kiwi, apple and orange was there. The croissant sandwich was just bland. Pain au chocolat was the only thing I liked 3. Spicy chicken burger: bad. Really bad. Tasteless. Fries were decent. 4. Mogador pastry: It was average but the base was tasteless."
18268360,Worms in apple pie
312011,Baked Love has been our go to for all birthday cakes for over three years now! Their customer service is top notch - Vatsala and Sonal really go out of their way to make sure they help you with choosing the best from their menu and keeping in touch with updates. They even took a request from my father who was all the way in Chennai and delivered a cake to me in Delhi!   Would highly recommend the Hazelnutella cake (and honestly everything else as well - can‚Äôt go wrong here)!
312011,"Probably one of the finest bakery in town!! This cute little place has the most delicious desserts and cold coffee. Infact my 18 months old is a big fan of their granolas too. Both Vatsala and Sonal are extremely welcoming and reminded us of a quaint cafe experience in a European old town. Cheesecake, cold coffee and chocolate tarts are our hot favourites here!!"
312011,"They really need to work on their customer experience if they want to succeed as a niche, high-end bakery. There is definitely potential but both their quality and approach needs to improve. If that that‚Äôs not possible, they should be 25% cheaper than they currently are, in my opinion."
312011,"Please try their hot chocolate it was super yum, topped with glazed marshmallows. You can decide between dark hot chocolate with no sugar and with sugar also."
312011,Loved this rainbow layered pastry loaded with chocolate . It is called choclate rainbow cake . It tasted delicious . Staff i really courteous
308315,Would like to comment on the breakfast spread. Been dining here for last 3 days and have found the spread to be pathetic and the reason had to go since was staying else would not go for sure. Very cold breakfast with all items cold and no respite on even asking for some hot food. All days had to have breakfast outside in spite of eating something here. Stay is good but food is pathetic Definitely not staying and dining here again
308315,"Twenty ten is located in the Ashtan Sarovar Portico, Green Park. The ambience and decors of the place are great and the food is also good.I visited it a few days back and my dining experience was nice although I had expected this place to be even better. Here is a list of items that I tried that day-  Chicken Spring Roll- Nothing too good and tastes above average.  Masala Uttapam- Tasted inferior to what I have had in some other south Indian food joints of the city.  Sweet Corn Soup- Comes with a choice of veg, chicken or seafood. Tastes good.  Tandoori Chicken- Tastes nice and has nothing to complain about.  Lamb Burger- Probably the best item of the evening. It is saut√©ed onions and eggs and tastes nice.  Thai Green Curry- This vegetable curry was fine but could have been better with a little addition of spices.  Mix vegetable-Ordinay and similar to any other good mix vegetable preparation that you might have had.  Aaloo Dhaniya- Has a rich taste of coriander and tastes fine.  Overall,the food here is nice and I am going with a rating of 3.5/5 for Twenty Ten."
308315,"I tried their buffet spread on a Saturday afternoon. The ambience of the place is above average. I tried their Hakka Noodles, Chicken Curry and Mixed Dal, along with the breads. While the food was nice, besides the rotis, whicj were too dry and a little undercooked, the service was horribly slow for bringing the breads, as well as replenishing the buffet items. If not for the bad service, would have given it a 3.5."
308315,"After a long day shopping for my brother's wedding at chandi chowk with my parents, we were exhausted when we got to our hotel. And slightly hungry.  Since all of us were feeling a little under the weather but dad likes to eat a full Indian meal, we ordered a thalidomide and decided to share it and mom called for a chicken Kathi roll.  Firstly, I love people who give me freebies which are useful! And what's more useful than food? Free food!!!  The hotel very politely offered me the chefs special dish for the day in the thali and when I informed them about 2 people sharing a thali, they sent us a gorgeous plate Leiden with generously served helpings of a dish of the day which was a paneer dish, alu matar, dal makhani, raita, kheer, rice, roti, pickle and papad.  The Kathi roll had a generous serving too! 2 rolls on one plate!  It might be a little pricey, but the foods lovely!"
308315,Mostly reserved for in-house guests you would find large groups during lunch. Nice bright interiors make the place inviting. The buffet offers basic variety and ain't that bad.
309322,"Look at these scrumptious cake pops, Aren't they looking just fabulous  ?    Yes these pretty looking cake pops were spotted at the grub fest held in JLN Stadium. As the pops look so pretty they tasted also quite yummy !   The outer layer was crunchy where as the inner was soft. The cake pops with some colourful sprinklers which just gave a beautiful taste.  P.s I am writing this review quite late as I didn't remember the name of the shop, but finally i managed and I wrote the review"
309322,Amazing and tasty cakes are available in this shop ... they have cakes in different variety flavours .... price is okay okay ... here we can  find a lot of design cakes too ..
309322,Had some chocolate stuff at their counter in The Grub Fest. Some really great cakes in jars which I loved. Delicious and eggless- what else do you want ‚ù§ a nice bakery all in all
18337744,So .... This is the only place for amazing  shakes I know in green park.... personal favourites are Cold coffee with ice cream blended and chocolate peanut butter shake......!Keventers
18337744,"Till 27th January i.e. tomorrow, all personnel's of armed forces and their family will be given a complimentary Milkshake by Keventers. What a nice gesture for people that serves and protects us. This place closes at 11 pm at night and I was just in time to enjoy their Milkshakes. Reasons, best known to them, as I started clicking pictures, they told me that photography wasn't allowed. That was bit odd, since no other Keventers that I have been to, has this rule. All the Milkshakes I had were my first try.  Mango Milkshake was the combination of Mango's as well as some artificial mango flavor. Peanut Butter Shake was superb. Strong taste of Peanuts and thickly made. Recommended Tutti Fruity was disappointing. I only had because I wanted to give it a try. Won't have it again. Overall, a good place to get your Shakes but go for their Thick Shakes."
18337744,I just visited this outlet few days back with my cousins and had a great time we ordered few shakes and just loved it and will recommend to everyone and will be visiting them very soon Great food=Great MEMORIES
18337744,"This place serves mind blowing ¬†Milkshakes and are truly legends in making their customers to crave for more.¬†  Almost they have 45+ outlets all around the Delhi and nearby but the quality and the consistence remains same.¬†  We tried their: Chocolate Oreo Shake ( 200/-)¬† Choco Chip (200/-)¬† Strawberry (150/-)¬† Exotic Strawberry (200/-)¬†  All were just perfectly thick and not sweet enough though which was quintessential for my taste buds.  Overall:¬†  Milkshakes: Exquisite and the best in town.¬†  Service: Utmost prompt¬†  Staff: Very Well Bred, Neatly dressed.¬†  Ambience: There is no sitting arrangement as such.¬†  Value for Money: Kind of Costly but never miss having it."
18337744,"I'm glad finally I have a Keventers outlet near my house! I'm totally loving the Choco Chip, Hazelnut, Kit Kat Shake and their Cold Coffee‚ù§Ô∏è I'm gonna try other flavours to, and I'm sure they'll as good as these four. But I LOVE THEM SO MUCH that I don't wish to try any other flavour! Also, the number of Keventers' bottles I have is endless now üòõ"
18432237,"Pizza lovers will never regret trying this place for the fabulous pizzas they offer with different combinations to choose.i tried their big Western cheese pizza 5/5 it was more than sufficient for two people it had chicken salami,bbq chicken onions and mozzarella cheese. Desert tried was molten lava cake 5/5 it was a little muffin with heart of chocolate,it was a actually a mouthwatering."
18432237,"This place never fails to impress you with their mesmerising pizzas. Ovenstory is an ultimate option to have amazing pizzas. If you're bored with the monotony after having pizzas from the same pizza Giants again and again, you should definitely give ovenstory a shot. Ovenstory is a delivery only outlet with branches all over the city. Their pizzas are really satisfying with loads of toppings. The flavour of the pizza is really good too. We tried the Famous five pizza which had a lot of toppings and cheese. The Paneer Tikka in the toppings was really flavourful. We would definitely recommend trying this place."
18432237,"Ovenstory is a great competition to the existing pizza chains which have already settled their roots in Indian mindsets. This is a really different kind of approach to change that traditional pizza thinking. The quality of food is really great and the cheese used was amazing. The size of the pizza is slightly bigger than the large pizza we see and the topping on the pizza was nicly spreaded and was adequate.Garlic bread had a crispy layer outside and had a cheesy filling inside, allover the garlic bread was good but it could be better. In the end I am a big fan of their Choco lava cake which is just delish in every bite."
18432237,I am a loyal customer of this brand and have tried many pizzas from this outlet. Non veg paradise pizza is my favourite among all the pizzas. The pizzas served here are always overloaded with cheese and enough toppings. This time i tried big western and it was amazing too. Delivery was on time
18432237,"Have ordered chicken pizza many times from other outlets of oven story but this time i tried a vegetarian pizza from here. I ordered famous five among the varied options listed in the vegetarian menu. This pizza was totally delicious and cheesy. With enough pieces of paneer tossed over a thin crust pizza layeredd with different tangy sauces, i totally enjoyed this heavenly delight and would recommend all vegetarians to try this. The delivery was on time and packaging was perfect."
18414479,The place deliver the best briyani and i have ever had and this is so good and try the same as well..
18414479,Order egg rice bowl first time from faasos. Bowl comes with combination of egg curry and rice. Rice was good in taste and curry were also good but curry quantity was less which can be better. Overall it was value for money.
18414479,"The most horrible cheesecake i could ever imagine. Firstly, the Biscotti layer is very thick and having the cinnamon butter taste to it which makes it really unrelatable to the whole sweetness factor. Secondly the texture of cheesecake is so hard. Waste of money."
18355419,"They have shifted , couldn‚Äôt find them  Phone numbers given are wring numbers  Went inside the building , 3 Rd floor , nothing .  So it has to be removed or updated in Zomato"
18355419,Spotted them at palate fest at Nehru Park. Wanted to try the freshly baked nachos. And we did. They are good. The best part were the nachos themself. They were very nice yellow-golden color. The salsa was good made it a great snack. Only a chilled pint of beer was missing to make it perfect. ;)
18355419,"tried their nacho bowl, it was awesome. one of the few places providing authentic Mexican food. Delivery was ok but needs a little work. Overall a great place."
18355419,Tasty & Clean üëçüèª not just great food üëçüèª great service. The order was there on time and Surabhi you were very helpful üòä will surely recommend friends & family and will visit you guys the next time I feel like having Mexican food ‚úåüèªÔ∏è
18355419,"Ate the nachos bowl , quinoa bowl nd their bae-ritto ..it tasted really nice and fresh with the authentic tastes... highly reccomended ... perfect for all Mexican food lovers ..."
18429154,"Chilli Singh:- A experience like never before at Chilli Singh , situated in Green Park , ambience was good there , service was also very nice , we had tried their veg spring rolls , wontons , pan fried dimsums. All the items were very good in taste and also very yummy especially spring rolls , so guys do have a visit to them."
18429154,"Finally visited this place with my family yesterday and our experience was amazing. We love the taste and presentation of food being served here. The place is near green Park metro station. We ordered- spring roll , pan fried dimsums, veg Chinese thaali. My personal favorite were spring rolls. I loved it."
18429154,Fresh food is served at this place. Chilli singh makes amazing chinese. And the service is really amazing. Its near to metro so convenient and they have outdoor sitting. Staff is courteous  Pan fried dimsums 4/5  Veg Wontons 4/5  Chinese combo 3/5  Veg Chinese Sizzler 4.5/5  We loved the ambience and the place. They have an elaborate menu do check.
18429154,This place is now my favorite for Chinese food. Yesterday i was here with my friend to try noodles and spring rolls but the food was good that we had to order some more dishes.  Chicken chilli garlic noodles were amazing. Quantity of chicken was impressive and they add egg in those noodles too.  Spring rolls were so  crispy and very well stuffed with veggies. And the best part was that they were absolutely fresh We also tried pan fried dimsums both chicken and veg. I found the chicken one better because they were very juicy.   Some more dishes like drums of heaven and cottage cheese sizzler were also good and worth to try.
18429154,"Recently I went CHILLI SINGH, at Green Park, is a cosy place for quick bites and the best chinese. Very good staff, Good Service, Amazing Food, Nice Location, Perfect presentation of food, Outdoot seating and value for money. . I had Chinese Platter, mild taste and light food. Chicken wontons, it was the best, crunchy, tasty, freshly made.( HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Chicken Dimsums, steamed, frest stuffing and very nicely presented. Chicken Noodles, juicy and not dry with chicken chunks. Drums of heaven, this tastes amazing. The best I've had till now. (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Chicken & Veg Spring Roll, Fresh and crispy with tasty stuffing.  A very nice pocket friendly place serves amazing lip smacking food. Must visit.  Rating- Food-5/5 Ambience-4.5/5 Service-5/5 Overall-5/5"
18334422,"We ordered a 700 ml pack of both Alphonso and coconut ice creams.The tub that we received wasn't even half full.Even though the tub says 700 ml ,the quantity was no more than 400ml. I didnt expect this from Baskin with it being such a big brand.These guys are openly cheating their customers."
18334422,The shake i ordered was so diluted I cannot even call it a shake. The quantity was horrible too.
18334422,This place is located in the green park. ... Have a friendly staff. ... Nice menu .... Delicious food items .... Many varities
18334422,Baskin Robbins has a variety of ice creams to choose from. We have tried a lot of flavours from here and really liked them. There ice cream is of great quality. This is a small outlet in main market of Green Park and also has a seating for around 4 people. Three cheers chocolate and mint chocolate are a must try!
18312607,This is my fav go to place Whenever I'm in need of a cosy place to sit. Like ambience and coffee Brownie is awesome
18312607,Cafe Coffee Day is a great place!  Their Cappuccino is the best thing in winters and my favourite from Cafe coffee day is there brownie and vanilla ice cream. that‚Äôs a must try.
18312607,Yesterday I visited cafe coffee day...and I ordered coffee and sandwich....coffee was yummy...good in taste....low sugar level...üëçüëåI'm loving it...
18312607,Staff is courteous and lovely. I ordered the frappe and I was impressed by the deliciousness of the food. It was a good experience and crowd was great too.
18180081,It's awfully bad. They served me so rotten mutton Biriyani that I have to throw it in dustbin. Only thing is they gave an appropriate amount in half. If possible I would have given 0.3 rating.
18180081,"It's unexpected, in the middle of Green Park, so light on pocket yet with awesome food, ambience, songsl Smooth yet spicy biriyani, mouth watering pasta, melting choco lava cake, that's all you can try in a visit. But all indications are they serve the rest equally mouth watering! Definitely worth the money, or may be more."
18336220,"Ordered food for home delivery -   I ordered a combo of 4 pizzas. The expected delivery time was one hour and the actual delivery happened after 1.5 hours.   The crust of the pizzas was half cooked and hard. The cheese was very sweet which ruined the taste of the pizza. Each pizza tasted the same be it capsicum, onion or corn.   The garlic bread was plain. No garlic powder or anything. It was again hard to chew.   They have tried to imitate Dominos but haven't really been successful at it. The only thing good is that their prices are economical.  Pizzas - 2/5  Garlic Bread - 2.5/5   Overall Rating - 2.5/5"
18336220,"Being a vegetarian, have consumed only vegetarian items.  Pros: Pizzas are cheaper compared to other Pizza chains. Their taste is also quite different. In pastas, only cheese variety is good. Tandoori pasta is also good provided they bake it properly.  Cons: Pastas are not properly baked and are many times raw. Quantity of pasta is less. Delivery personnel never have any change of money, despite asking the order taker to send change. Choco Lava is unavailable most of the time. If available, is many times gooey and raw."
18336220,"Pizza was good in taste, but quantity was below expectation. I ordered cheese margarita which cost me 300, and I expected something else from You."
18336220,"Their pizzas are very good and even less expensive than other pizza chains. They can improve their home delivery which takes 45-50 minutes. However, the pizzas were worth the wait and money."
18336220,"Da pizza corner serves some good pizzas to satisfy your cravings for the pizza.  The pizza's are good but not upto the mark in quality and quantity wise, we have ordered fresh veggies pizza but as the name suggest the veggies should be fresh and the quantity should be good but the scene was different."
304230,"One of my fave spots to pig out in green park.  Vegetarians will certainly swoon over it but a carnivore like myself also loves to indulge here.   The nutri soya Tikka is addictive af and super delish, healthy too! I don‚Äôt think anyone else around does a nutri Tikka so this place definitely pulls me back for that dish.  Paneer Tikka is soft & Spicy. Soya Tikka is average but overall I‚Äôd definitely recommend Pastry Palace for those who love tandoori food, even the carnivores will enjoy it.  It‚Äôs a humble little outlet serving standard delish food at very nominal rates. No drama, simple and quick yummy food!"
304230,"If you are a tikka & kebabs lover. It's a perfect place for you. They has some varieties of tikka and kebab like soya tikka, soya kebab, mushroom tikka. I really like their jackfruit ( kathal) tikka the most. Price is also quite reasonable. Although you won't get a place to sit but it in open place where there are a few chairs over there to sit and eat. It's one of my favorite place to hog on!!"
304230,"How about some cheap thrills? These marinated veggies are grilled perfectly expect a slightly smokey flavour on skewers in an open tandoor. They have the usual paneer, along with a bunch of innovative tikkas such as mushroom, dhingri, and gobhi. It‚Äôs indeed a heaven for all the vegetarians out there.   So next time you find yourselves in Green Park Market, do take out time to indulge in the tikkas. They are definitely worth a taste."
304230,Its so rare to find a place that serves pure veg tikkas and chaap. Its light on the pocket and heavy on the stomach. The tikkas taste good as well. Will visit again.
304230,"I have chilled in the market so much and have always been fascinated by the tikkas they serve in what we can call a live counter ...I love the paneer tikka mostly but they are best eaten hot ...I once packed some and took to Gurgaon which got soggy and lost their soul ...but when walk by ..do dig in to them served hot, they make tasty and healthy evening snacks to me :)   Cheers !"
18261052,Food üç¥ is awesome. Must try !
306247,Subway is one of our favourite places to go to. Their Chicken Tikka Sub is my favourite. Good quality food and veggies.
306247,"Subway is one of my favorite food chains, but I was extremely disappointed with today‚Äôs order. I had ordered a teriyaki chicken sub with valencia orange raw juice. They sent the wrong raw pressery botlle as you can see in the photos. The packaging was good but my experience was terrible with the wring order. Please be careful next time"
306247,Good food
306247,"One of the very tasty sub and very healthy and taste is really awesome , on time delivery and packaging is also nice and the chicken is very fresh‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è..Loved it‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è"
5267,"Never go for fish curry , fish fry is good though , one more thing I don't know why but felt something not nice , some unpleasant feeling with the owner, his way of asking, serving, his gestures"
5267,"Owner cheats a lot in money, so plz beware on handling with bill amount, no respect to student who eat regularly their. If you didn't notice, he will add up money .. same lunch every day if you take one month package, and dinner repeats too..."
5267,Food is fine but they don't treat customers properly The owner acts like a boss for everyone including the people who serve food more attitude..
5267,"I love their food. Every time I have a craving for South Indian food and Prawns, I simply head over to their place."
5267,"Wonderfully unpretentious little place that serves honest Kerala cuisine. Skip the dosas and idlis and go for the light thaali, the meat or egg Kerala-style roasts, fish curry, and parottas. You'll also get decent water buffalo dishes, such as curries, fry, or masala. Just call for ""erachi""!  Don't expect much of an ambiance as this is a humble place that's fashioned after the rice hotels of Southern India. The cheap prices add to the appeal. Highly recommended for foodies who prefer taste over fanciness."
18335682,Pretty good ambience  I tried nutella cheese cake. It was looking mouth watering and tasted good. Base was good and overall it was well balanced in terms of sponge and flavors.  Next was whoopie pie. It was above average. Last thing I tried my hands on was Sinful chocolate tart!  I usually love chocolate tarts. How they melt in your mouth.  How the very soft mesmerising base goes with flow in your mouth is too good.  Their tart was good too. It wasn't as good as I tried before but I liked it. Adorable icing on desserts.  It was fun visiting Lost in frost!  Warm regards Bani
18335682,Lovely gooey cakes.. excellent taste and prompt home delivery. Also I placed the order in the morning and they delivered it the very same evening. Good going guys!
18335682,This place was recommended by a friend.. so glad that he did .. have ordered a few cakes from Drishty and I must say her cakes are addictive.. just too good.. chocolate hazelnut and chocolate velvet are my favourites.. highly recommend Chocklat velvet.. way to goüòä
18335682,"So, let me tell you guys if youre a fitness freak and like the others m you too crave desserts.. This is the right place to land to. My brother being a big fitness freak , I had to order something thats healthier than the rest. Drishty made a lovely wholewheat butter-free and sugarfree banana walnut cake. It was just too too good. The perfect blend of taste. Very subtle. Just the most appropriate flavour of banana. Just too too good for a gym freak.. loved it to the core..  A MUST TRYY.."
18335682,Amazing! We ordered a customized Chocolate Velvet cake..it was simply amazing! They are very detail and customer centric..happy to include any and all of your preferences/personalizations.  Do try!
310259,i have been here with my family allot. Ordered masala dosa and idli+vada. Sambar is really really good and chutney was good too. Place is good but not too amazing
310259,This is a small place but the south indian food has real authentic kind of taste . There are many things which I have tasted from this place and the quality remains the same everytime and I guess this is the best thing . The quantities are sufficient enough to feed two people from 1 order and its totally cost effective. I WOULD SERIOUSLY RATE EVERYTHING I HAVE HAD SO FAR LIKE 4.5 OR 5. Yeahh it was that good. Masala dosa Rawa masala dosa Veg Uttapam Mushroom rice Tomato rice These are my fav among all.
310259,North Indian Thali (online order)- Food is quite good but not as per rate but packing quality is poor dal came out in cutlery... So try to improve packing quality and little improvement needs for taste too..
310259,"Pure veg restaurant for dine inn and home delivery. Visited here for first time, interiors is average and service was also slow. Had coffee and noodles which was good."
310259,Worst kind of service. Arrogant staff. Waited 30 min for tea after finishing the food and finally had to leave without drinking it because I was getting late for work. No apologies from the owner or the staff.Food is average. I just went there because it is on my way work and their attitude has ensured I shall never go there again neither I'll recommend this place to anyone.
18359259,Awesome ice creams ! Place is small but it‚Äôs fun to be there late night! Menu is good! I also tried ice cream cakes as well ! They were great as well !
18359259,Whats better than eating ice cream in winters havmour is best to place to have sundaes i myself prefer havmour
18430873,"I visited this place this afternoon. It looked pretty cute and turned out to be pretty amazing.  I had : Pink lemonade - 4/5 I thought it to be something sweet, the colour just made me think of this drink to be sweet and pleasing but it was a masala lemonade, completely different from what I thought. It was still really delicious üòã  America chilli cheese fries üçü - 4.5/5 they were amazing. Chicken chucks with gravy and cheese sauce on top of fries. Truly love. Just one suggestion - put more chicken chunks and little big pieces.  I had one disappointment that the menu on Zomato, says customisation option but it was there on the outlet. They had closed customisation option and made new menu also. They should update same on Zomato as well. I wanted my custom made fries but i was happy with what I ordered üòä"
18430873,"Those who love fries with toppings should really head to this place. They have variety of toppings to go with and some of them are really delicious. Outlet is small with just around 3-4 seatings space. But the outdoor seatings of The Junction is pretty good. And, I ordered Mexicano fries which had sour cream , salsa sauce and cheese sauce on top with veggies being onions and we asked them to add jalapenos. The whole thing was , indeed, good with flavours bursting in my mouth. Sour cream gave fries an amazing taste, but I believe quantity served could be better.  For drinks , I had their Iced Tea and it was also delicious with balance and subtle taste . It had right amount of sweetness.  Overall , the place is worth a visit."
18430873,Best place when you‚Äôre just craving for good fries üçü  I really loved the way they serve the fries.  But you can just have that twisty flavour in the beginning only.
18430873,"Not just the food was mouth-watering but the customer service was amazing which definitely adds up. Overall good experience, food was served within 10 minutes, super fast service. And of course the ambience, ideal place for groups, couples to hangout and chill. Great job potet team, 5 stars!üëçüèª"
18430873,"Fries is one of the most loved food in the world. It makes us happy and works as a mood swinger. There are specific outlets which serve only curated fries with sauces and toppings. Potet is one such name and got to try it during Hot Chocolate Festival.   Ended up paying 105 bucks including taxes, I got a very small portion of fries with chocolate and mayo sauce. It was smaller than the size of a single potato. At first, I thought it's complimentary but it wasn't. Tastefully, the fries were little soggy and the sauces couldn't help much.   I've tried a lot of outlets which declare distinct fries as their specialty and for now, I can't recommend Potet."

18440414,"Coffee: 2,5  Food: 3.0  Service +ambience: 3 Staff - 2  Their batch brew on that day was not great! Has a crisp aftertaste and smells so weird. I tried their pancake and a vegan chocolate cake. It was just okay, even pairing with the coffee and beautiful view didnt make it perfect!"
18440414,Best Veg Pizza So Far!¬† We tried Caesar Salad Pizza & trust me it was the best pizza with such amazing thin crust base I ever tried. A must try! :)
18440414,"Was there yesterday. The menu on Zomato is totally different from the actual menu, which has limited stuff. Had to wait almost 20 minutes just for the order, which was Nacho Salad, Cappuccino, Orange Juice and an Omelette. The quality of the food was good. Orange juice was just exceptional.  Would I visit it again? Perhaps no. The service is not up to the mark. Staff seems uninterested towards the customer needs and issues."
18440414,"The place was well lit & had a beautiful decor as I entered this pure vegan place with high hopes , however their service is hopeless, the waiter seemed lost in his own world, we had to keep asking for everything thing starting from menu, then we asked twice to place our order, & surprisingly the place was empty not that they were running a full house that could cause such issues... they kept talking loudly amonst themselves abt the orders which could be well heard outside & wasn't pleasant to listen to... at one  point we even thought to leave,, their beet root nomad soup & the pesto pasta were both on a bland sideb& overly priced... Many places serve better much much better pastas & not even charge 500 bucks fr it... wrong choice to dine there...."
18440414,"One of the best cafe in the place. Serene, friendly staff and awesome food. Loved it. Go by chef recommendation. Good-okaish ambiance and great music"
18449796,Sadly the experience of food from BFS has been deteriorating. I believe there are no thorough checks on what gets packed and delivered.
18449796,It looks like either the restaurant or the delivery guy had eaten half of the order before it gets delivered. Nothing tastes fresh.
18449796,Bread for sandwich was stale so overall disappointing
18449796,Nice food and sandwishes
313482,Peri peri fried chicken wings:  The wings were bland. I couldn't find an ounce of Peri peri in there. Giving three stars only because they were adequately fried.
313482,"The little smidgen of white was the only sign of feta in my Greek salad.  I thought greek salad usually has cubes of feta in it, what happened?"
313482,"I just ordered a chilli cheese toast from here. I am thoroughly disappointed! The order came after 1.5 hours.....the toast was cold....there was a smell of plastic in the toast and it was not even good. Honestly, I would rather pay half the amount and go eat a chilli cheese toast at a local kiosk or restaurant."
313482,"I spent the last half hour picking wet tissue which was stuck to my cold and wet burger surrounded by 5, maybe 6 fries. Dogs on the street eat better than this. Pathetic is the only word. The manager himanshu seemed to not care either"
313482,I have ordered onion rings and pita and hummus quite a few times now and they never fail to impress me! Best restaurant to satiate those midnight hunger pangs
306658,They send empty packets and day by day their packaging size was reduced. Not recommended at all.
306658,"Extremely disappointed service. Placed order for tandoori chicken and kebab. This restraunt just served days old tandoori + kebab was another shock They sent the frozen kebab. Cheaters and fraud restraunt. Zomato! Stop ruining your brand image, tying knots with restraunts alike riyaz will destroy it soon"
9640,I have had pastries and cakes from this bakery since I was a kid and it never seems to bore me or want to change anything about it. They have new innovations and new preparations every time I have gone there. They have a good Pastry chef that much I know.
9640,"What used to be a great Patisserie is now quite dilapidated. The interiors don't look the same & the bakery goods are also very less in variety. I had one Veg sandwich & a red velvet cake, both were a huge dissapointment. The sandwich was too squishy with a lot of cheese & less fresh veggies & the cake was just full of colouring instead of the ingredients of a red velvet cake. Pretty sad."
9640,"A place where you will almost all sweet items. From cakes to cookies to ice creams they have everything on the menu.  I highly recommend to try their walnut brownie , superb in taste .  You can also customise your cake according to the way you want ."
9640,"Collections, in the Essex farms is a outlet which have pastries, savoury snacks, ice creams, cookies, sweets and many other packed variety of confectioners and many other items!üòÉ Its a pretty old place but their hygiene is the one thing i really like about it.ü§ó  They also customise cakes for different occasions. My favourite is their chocolate tart and walnut brownieüíó All their cakes are divine and a total blissüëçüèª"
9640,"My quick bite place! Introduced to me by a dear friend some two years ago, now I usually end up driving by when in South Delhi and need of a quick bite to eat. Simple snack items, but only very minimal gluten free offering. Usually get a Coffee or a Chocolate or a Sweet on the go."
305040,Been there few days back and it was a okay okay experience as they were providing a less quantity proportion as compared to others and food quality was okay not so bad or not so good. Ambience was perfect. Outdoor standing and takeaways.
305040,Worst kadai chap of my life. It was all pepper . How to make these morons understand that pepper does not cover shit product
18471243,"The most horrible sandwich I have ever had. It is stale , the tofu is extremely chewy and hard. The sauce is quite disgusting. There‚Äôs no combination , things are thrown in a sandwich."
18471243,A place to try the REAL HOT CHOCOLATE.

18423871,"Finally, I gave a try to food refill . Menu looked very impressive and promising with variety of dishes. I tasted Veg Noodles , Veg Rice and Noodles mix and Chicken Mix Noodles. Veg Noodles and Rice Noodles Mix were total disaster but still edible. There was no taste except oil used in it. Chicken Egg mix noodles was a bit ok but not up to the mark. Chicken Momos were upto the mark , they were juicy ,tasty and good. One of bad noodles I ever had. Their daily special on Monday which was Rajma Chawal ,wasn't up to the mark. Maybe other things taste a bit better.  2*"
18423871,"I had always liked the way they make their sandwiches, Kathi rolls and noodles. It's super affordable, enough quantity to satisfy your hunger. Tastes fresh, nothing over the top, balanced, packaging is always neat. Owner is really nice, to have a chit-chat. A great place for students, young adults, and anybody to have a nice, comfortable food."
18423871,Ordered chicken momos fried and chicken sandwich  Momos were terrific!  Sandwich was average but generous amount of filling  Delivery was on time Decent packing Will order again
18423871,Had ordered  Red sauce pasta Egg Hakka noodles Veg fried rice  Pasta was tasty but was too sweet with the tomato sauce.  Egg Hakka noodles was very dry and wasn't as tasty as in other reviews Veg fried rice was fine but was again dry
18423871,The food is good. Delivery is on time. They also listen to your specifications and prepare your order according to it. Owner is also good. Best part is that it's pocket friendly  and they have a lot of variety.
303170,"This is the place, if you are looking for tasty Chinese food that doesn't cut a hole in your pocket then you have to try this and believe me once you try this you will not go anywhere else. I've been eating at this place since last two years and this is my go to places for my momo craving. Definitely give it a try"
303170,"The momos here are great! Super tasty! The price range too is very pocket friendly, so it's a win win. Will choose rapti over other Chinese shops any day :)"
303170,Amazing food at a very reasonable price. Very polite and friendly staff. The service is prompt with proper cutlery. Rapti serves the best Chinese food. It's a must try.
303170,"Nice place for meets. Good food with great ambience, infrastructure, food and obviously staff. Today's meet contain lot of varieties of food. My dish cheese noodles nd spring roll with meauni nd chilly garlic sous. The food was hot and tasty. Really loved the ambience and music."
305736,Cafe coffee day is my favourite place for brownie. They serve one of the best brownies by the name of Crackle Brownie. It tastes best with ice cream.
305736,"Great place to chill out with friends and being situated inside IIT campus makes it a better choice! We ordered devil's own , cappuccino and cheese chilly toast."
305736,"I am a usual visitor here, the system often never works, so I did not get a bill as usual today. I Y got a burnt sandwich today that too after a long wait."
305736,"The best part of this ccd is that it's in IIT Delhi which is an amazing feel in itself if you wish to relive your college days. The outlet is subsidised over others. Chilly cheese toasties is a must try. The sandwiches are nice too, specially roasted chicken. Cafe Coffee Day"
309593,The momos are extremely delicious. I've tried quite a few places and always felt like something was missing. But now I'm only going to be ordering from here. Amazing taste.
309593,I had ordered for one portion of chicken in black bean sauce and one chicken fried rice. The chicken in black bean sauce was really bland and the chicken was tough to chew. The fried rice was equally bland and had only 3-4 small pieces of shredded chicken in them which was also tough to chew. I had read other reviews but still wanted to go ahead and try it out but unfortunately faced the same issue like many others.
309593,I ordered pork noodles. The quantity was overwhelming. The food was less spicy. Overall it's budget friendly and a good deal. The food was delivered on time.
300564,It's been my most regular daily bakery products place. Not many people have the taste of the old school bakery stuff but I still do. The ratings don't matter to me when it comes to them . This bakery has been there before all these fast food joints and the new modern bakeries had opened and is still surviving with its own unique taste and charm.
300564,It is one of the most underrated pastry shop. It is located in hauz khas main market. I bought choco chip cake and it was damn good. Even the inside layers were full of choco chip. I really loved the cake.
300564,I used to be regular customer till today morning.... I used to buy their rusks and buiscuits so regularly that the owner at least knew me by face. A pack of rusk that I bought from there smelled so awful that I decided to bring it to the shop owner's notice. To my surprise when I went to his shop the owner started blaming me ( that I must have bought the packet from somewhere else) and disagreed completely of that product been sold from his shop!  What a person he is!! Had I not bought it from his shop why would I waste my time doing all this for just a pack worth RS.55/- There has been two more instances when I realised that he compromises on the quality of the products being sold at his outlet which made me go to his shop to return the stale  packet of rusk today. I would never recommend this outlet to anyone and rate it zero out of five. It's not about a pack of rusk but it's about knowing your customers and treating them well.  Why do I have to even give it a rating of 1.0
300564,A bakery shop in the main Hauz Khas market selling bakery items along with snacks. I was in the market along with a friend when I desired to have pastry. We had Butterscotch and Black Forest pastries.  Black Forest though looked appealing but its taste was down-graded. The size was huge but it could have been made in a better way. Butterscotch was a saviour. It was soft and tasted nice.
300564,"Although this place still serves a lot of old school classic 90's flavors like the pineapple, of which we are big fans at home, and the truffle and black forest this 1.0 rating goes to the son of the owner who sits in the evening at times and is super laid back and arrogant. No sense of how to deal with customers, even heard him casually abusing with his employees. I hope he does something for this old bakery which im sure the family has a lot of hopes from. This is one bakery which just isn't catching up with time, especially in today's time of extremely high competition. All the best to this place! (y)"
5897,This place serves the best Kathi rolls in Delhi.  The small outlet in kalu sarai is the best place for all the students studying at the coaching centres in the vicinity. The minimum order value is ‚Çπ300. Which is a little troublesome for me because I love aloo rolls that cost ‚Çπ25-30. I ordered 10 rolls to enjoy them after a long time!
5897,"This is the place where i fell in love with Kathi rolls, i am a vegetarian, i had the aloo roll here..  I had the same feeling like inspector Clussue has in the movie pink panther when he eats a Hamburger for the first time.. I love the kathi roll her with crispy roti, extra nimbu, sweet n chilly sauce...  Yummmyy..."
5897,This place offers a variety of rolls at reasonable prices. Went with friends here after a friend praised about the rolls very much. I tried their Egg Chicken Keema Roll and it was decent in taste with good amount of stuffing inside. The keema was well prepared too.  A good place to try if you are a huge fan of rolls!
5897,"This shop is really good for rolls .... I had egg, chicken mutton and paneer rolls .... mutton roll was really awesome ... service also okay ...."
5897,"A decent place where you get varieties of rolls !! You may try any of them , they will not disappoint you!!! According to me mutton keema roll is greatt!!"
18382353,it was a visit with my parents and the ambiance was nice and the staff was courteous. The food was bland But starters were amazing. Chicken 65 was amazing. soups were good. The salad counter was amazing. do try their desserts especially gur kheer
18382353,"A perfect dine in experience and beautiful ambience of the restaurant.  We had tried  Crispy crunchy sushi - 3.5/5  Well cooked and crispy delicacy served well too.   Chandi paneer tikka - 4.5/5  Amazingly cooked, the marination was superb and the presentation was really eye catchy.   Chilly Garlic noodles - 4/5  Good portion size and cooked to perfection.   Arrabbiata spaghetti - 4/5  The taste was great though had asked for extra broccoli but still it was amazing. Good portion size too. Could have been served with garlic bread too."
307436,We enjoy food and services which is given by Abhishek and Vishal they are very helpfull and brilliant in his services thank you both of you we came again
307436,Satyendra took very good care of our stay and ensured we have a truly pleasant experience. See you soon again
307436,Kanika was an excellent in supporting my gluten allergy request and advised what I can eat. She is with high ethics and good support. I definitely recommend to promote her. Thank you very much!
307436,"Let me start by saying that it doesn't matter what went wrong however what matters most is how was that situation handled or attended to.  Running a busy restaurant is not easy and things are bound to go wrong however when the very people who are suppose to enhance your experience start to spoil it that's when everything spirals down for worst.  Worst experience of walk in dine in in a five star hotel.  No one attended at restaurant entrance, was offered a table which wasn't ready, incomplete table set up, missing food order, delayed orders, and very incompetent and arrogant outlet manager.   Stay away from the place after 10pm."
306815,"Great offers during evening. Happy hours are super value of money, and the restaurant team is very generous in doing repeat servings of nuts and chips. Though Ambience is average."
306815,Good food with good vibes. The food tasted really yummy with decent amount of serving. Nice place to hangout with friends at night and have fun üëçüèº
306815,"Named creatively to meld sports bar and lounge, Slounge belongs to that sub-genre of retro sports bar serving straight forward liquor and comfort food. The best way to enjoy this chic bar in Lemon Tree Premier, Aerocity with its relaxed seating, Retro posters and billiards table is to dress casual and immerse yourself in old-school music!  Speaking of my visit, I headed to the pub at 8 with buddies. The team welcomed us, made us comfortable and we took the reserved corner table after admiring the retro wall. It's these small, significant gestures that make the experience delightful. Perusing the menu, I ordered Vodka and my health-conscious friends chose to go with fresh juice. We then ordered aggressively as we were all tired and hungry after a day packed with meetings. The manager answered queries and made thoughtful suggestions so pretty soon we settled back amid giggles and animated conversation.  Soon, the dishes were served. Up first was 'Shikampuri Kebab', seared to give a hint of doneness and melt-in-the-mouth texture. I can confidently say the ground lamb patties is better than any I've had in Hyderabad, surprisingly light and intensely flavored. Next, 'Nimbu Achari Jheenga' was off- the- hook fresh. The jumbo prawns rubbed with lime and spices was easily star of the evening, as it satiated hunger pangs and murmurs of satisfaction were involuntary elicited! Since we were all sea- foodies, we were looking forward to the next one too: 'Oats and Flax Breaded Fish Fingers.' The fish, breaded in oatmeal and flaxseeds, was deep-fried, piping hot, sumptuous‚Ä¶ and demolished in no time! The perfect bar snack!! As time wore on, the Vodka was potent, the retro music foot tappin'‚Ä¶ and then the vegetarian dishes arrived. 'Steamed Silken Tofu With Lemon Chilli Garlic' released a bouquet of flavours and was purr-fect comfort food! 'Broccoli and Rose Petal Shammi' is one of their signatures and unlike anything I've had! If you're a vegetarian, and even if you're not, you must try it! I was looking forward to the last one, 'Grilled Button Mushroom‚Äô, since I'm a fan of shrooms. And I was not disappointed. The flavour of the fine mushrooms was heightened with roasted chilli sauce. Simply sumptuous!!  Thoughts that stayed with me when we walked out at 11 p.m. was that there's a tradition at Slounge‚Äîto ensure guests leave with memories of fine cocktails, flavourful snacks, get-up-and-dance music‚Ä¶ embellished with excellent service and attractive pricing. A must-visit at any hour. Cheers!!"
306815,"Had a beautiful experience of hosting our mom dad 40th anniversary party here and watta party it was! Extra caring service and yummilicious food. Lebanese chicken and kaleji were the best. Mr. Rajat attention to minute details were commendable. Surely, getting back here soon for another party."
307383,"I liked the breakfast buffet  . Enough varieties served . Even had kheer . Usually for breakfast in any hotel buffet,  only some pastries and banana cake will be served . So it was a pleasant surprise to see moong dal kheer ."
307383,They have great ambience with good sitting and dinning space.  I visit this cafe last week for lunch .  They serves some amazing quick bites
307383,"We turned to this place as a forward from Citrus, which was full in capacity. The buffet here had very limited servings. Just one non veg snack (fish amritsari-only above average dish) and 2 non veg gravy (chicken and fish). The quality of servings was below average. It includes Dal tadka, arbi sabzi, Loki sabzi, paneer and matar, rice, noodles, veg gravy besides above. In the dessert segment their main dish was Carrot kheer (below average), butterscotch icecream, cham cham, chocoalte and red velvet half- pastries. The replacement of food service was extremely poor and the containers remained empty for more than 40 mins. Only the up side was service of Phem, who despite, poor food availability, was polite in serving."
307383,"I came for a dinner in clever fox , staffs were very polite and courteous . Menu could be more interesting and unique then usual. I loved the chicken curry and dahi wada.  I also saw pumpkin kheer which i had never seen till date. I was wondering how it would taste. But beating all dessert it was mouth watering and tasted excellent. All thanks to chef pradeep for an excellent job.  Rest everything was clean , well maintained and in dinning discipline. I would love to visit again ,but i would want more variety in main course.  Thank you Prateek singh"
18408062,"Visited this place recently, the best part is its ambiance- from the Entrance to bar, sitting everything looks niche' & the bar is very well stocked. The lights fixtures on horse head looks kinda funny , they could have arranged lighting in other decent ways too, though the big Horses give it a distinct overall Polo Club kinda look. The bar offers good deal on the drinks (booked via Dineout) and in the menu there are 5 starters veg and 5 non veg, the size of the portions are pretty decent . Good for formal meetings or quick quite conversations, for fun there are many in Aerocity"
18408062,beautiful ambience & amazing cocktails make this place stand apart ! Also it is not very expensive so good to hang out with colleagues ! highly recommended
18408062,Visited this place to meet a friend who was staying there.  This is one of the many restaurants of Pride plaza hotel.  I must say food is very disappointing. We ordered masala aloo and soya chaap along with some drinks üçπ   Bad presentation  Disappointing food Poor service  They take ages to get you even a glass of water.  1 rating is just for the ambience. Otherwise I would rate this place negative üëé.  NotsoActuarial  By Indu Bansal
18408062,I haven‚Äôt experienced a service worse than this place!! Average food but a bad service just puts you off. Avoid this one. There are other better hotels in the vicinity
18408062,Visited this place recently. I must say I haven‚Äôt seen a service poorer than this one. They took forever to just get starters and when finally the starters arrived they were cold! Extremely poor!
18316173,Their chicken salad is really good. Nice place with good service. Their food is fresh and yummy. Yummy!
18316173,I have given 4 star because the food was good enough and unlimited drinks refill is really attractive deal but the sitting area is so much crowded that is only one weak point about this place. Otherwise a nice place to hangout ‚ù§Ô∏è
18316173,These day I am on diet and having salads. I ordered salads from subway. It had lots and lots of veggies. I really loved it.   Healthy tasty dinner.
18316173,"Who doesn‚Äôt like having Subway ?   Ordered a Sub from Sector 62 outlet and got it delivered on time.  Taste was good as always.  Quantity of paneer/chicken is always good.

9709,Went there for Buffet breakfast. The food was good and fresh. Enjoyed the ambiance : light music.  Totally worth the money spent as they covered many varieties. Loved the mini rasmalai :)  Good place to go for a change.
9709,went for a breakfast buffet. decent variety of food on offer. service was prompt. pleasant ambience.definitely commands multiple visits.
9709,Went there for buffet breakfast . Nice setup and fresh food with a wide variety. Only the brown bread tasted stale.  Egg preparation was fresh.  Indian breakfast options were more.  Nice go to place for breakfast . .
306251,"Their service is one of the worst in Delhi. Rates are high, as expected, but their service is horrible. One of the guys who served used pathetic language and when asked why he delayed, he angrily responded 'Yahaan pe to yahin hota hain'."
306251,It' an average bar. Very bad atmosphere. The staff is very arrogant. It is better to go to some other place as it will surely disappoint you.
306251,pathetic service and arrogant staff. I'll never go again there. the staff could have been more kind. very disappointed. uchi dukaan feeka paiwak!
306251,Superbly done up interiors! A stunning chandilier with an exquisite malt collection is what one gets upon entering the bar! The much quiet fancy place has a beautiful show case which is beautiful!
306251,Another great part of this wonderful property. You cannot no love the food at Marriott's. Had a coffee and burgers and it was wonderful. The presentation is excellent and the way this place has been decorated makes you feel happy !!!

18384123,"1. Ordered After Dark Fantasy Sundae with extra Dark Chocolate Covering. 2. The Sundae comes in a beautiful and sturdy glass container. That is where the goodness of the sundae ends. 3. The sundae is supposed to come with mint sauce, chocolate ice-cream, chocolate chunks and baked brownie. While it delivers on the first two fronts, there isn't enough chocolate chunk or baked brownie.¬† 4. Pricing is a bit on the higher side especially given the inadequacy of the toppings."
18384123,"I like this particular outlet because of its cleanliness and services , they provide good shakes but not very thick shakes .... and bit expensive everyone can't afford it every day... but once a week it's good"
18384123,"Nice ice cream blueberry flavour I ordered three flavour chocolate blueberry and butterscotch yammi taste and good location at aerocity, well frozen and colour"
18384123,If you want sad melted ice cream for milkshakes Keventers is the place for you. Cannot believe how a milkshake place can screw up the one thing they make! We ordered Chikoo milkshake and mango shake both tasted like melted vanilla ice cream with some hint of fruit for namesake! To add to this pathetic service by the staff.
18425766,"Chidyaghar Bar is a Bar/Pub located at Roseate House, New Delhi. It specializes in Modern Indian cuisine.Whether you are considering an after-work pint and bite, a cosy date night destination, or a dwelling to catch up with your friends, Chidiyaghar is a great spot for a comfort outing. The 'Wild Mushroom Galouti' with pickled onions and roti croutons, the 'jackfruit and mango relish kebab' and the 'Edgamme' & Masal fries set the tone for the rest of the snacking; food that is comfortable and imaginative."
18425766,A fantastic place to.unwind and have a few drinks with friends or colleagues after work . The small plates menu is imaginative and refreshing. We loved the burrata fritters and the veg tandoori.platter . Also do they thier signature Paul John Whisky cocktails

18439530,The food hall cafe at Aerocity has a good variety of stuff. There gifting range is quite good. Although the eatery inside doesn't have much variety and is fine. Nothing very great to eat Rating 4/5 Food 3/5 Ambience 5/5 Variety 5/5
18439530,"The cafe by foodhall is one of the best place to visit..the taste is very good and service is nice, we have ordered veg pasta and sandwich..both are amazing in taste"
18439530,"This place gets an extra star solely for the value for money you get. We had a couple of their meal bowls and liked them. The desserts are also nice. The best part is you get to do this just after you have indulged in shopping at Central, window or otherwise !"
18439530,"Very bad coffee, no flavour of coffee at all and full of milk. I changed it twice still like that. I should have gone to costa only. I suppose they need to have a good barista."
18439530,"This new outlet by one of my fav brands is quiet amazing. The food they serve is very tasty. I tried veg pasta, mushroom bruchetta, pesto pasta and schezwan rice. The service and the taste of the food is commendable."
310032,Preity of F&B services as she went out of her way to serve us on 23rd December 19 as the lunch Buffett had already been done. She was courteous and very kind enough to provide for us as where the others had neglected. Thank you once again for having such an amazing staff.
310032,"So I ordered for breakfast in room , because I was not well and was suffering from female problem , so requested them to send the breakfast in the room , was offering cut fruits and khichdi for the breakfast , so insisted them to give something else , clearly they denied and inform that if you want to have anything else then have to go to the buffet, I already informed them about the condition and uneasiness so they said they can‚Äôt do anything for that , so heart breaking to see such kind of behaviour,"
310032,Lovely friendly staff
310032,Great place to unwind. Memorable service by Sanjay. Great food by Chef Shubh... delicious..
18429396,"Had a wonderful time at Juniper Bar. Great cocktails I have had in a long time. Great service from Himanshu, Mukul, and Deepak. Highly recommended. Will definitely come back again.. Recommend place"
18429396,"I'd like to congratulate the owner for this sublime idea of creating this absolutely energetic bar, firstly. Secondly, I'd like to compliment you for this willful enthusiasm to serve us better. Your staff did what was required. Even I say they did more than they could. Thirdly, coming to the dishes. The names I tell you. I've had a serious prob here.¬† Amritsari Goat Milk Paneer, Mint Chutney Bun Tikki, Amarnath Potato Patty, Masala Onion and Chutney Char Roasted Pork Belly, Royal Cumin Masala and Crispy Fried Onion and Fresh Watermelon, Tomcat Collins. Now it'd my suggestion can you please cut down the dishes name? It's embarrassing for the person who wants to type but in fact can't type.¬†¬† Anyway, I'd say that y'guys did an awesome job. However, next time when I'll come, I want the dishes name to be shorten a bit. I guess you can do this. I'm going with 4/5."
18429396,I really likeee the place and menu and service was also good..! Server was polite and had explained us the concept of Juniper Bar which was really amazing üíìüíìüíìü§ü.
18384135,The shake was good and staff was polite and friendly.Nice place to spend a quality time.kitkat shake was really awesome. Fully satisfied with the service.
18384135,The staff here is super friendly . Shakes that i have tried COLD COFFEE- 3.5/5 which i feel is overpriced. KITKAT SHAKE- 4/5 amazing refreshing shake you also get a small kitkat free free free! APPLE CUSTARD SHAKE- 4/5 for all the people who likes the flavour can go for it.     Fact for the day-Also they use flavours not real fruit and they add icecream to make it thick.
18384135,"Keventer's is an outlet in Food Capital from where you can by a milkshake from a variety of options. The milkshakes are pretty decent in taste, though I feel they are over priced.  Taste ~4/5 Ambience ~ 3/5 Variety ~ 3.5/5 Value for money ~2.5/5"
18384135,Being a chain franchise i found the taste different why i don't have an idea. The same milk shake had a different taste at ambiance gurgaon and please slash down your price or make it inclusive of tax
18384135,Keventers has always been my favorite place to order from when it comes to shakes. Their bottles and straws are ubercool. Recently tried their Bubblegum & Snicker shake. Both of them were quite good.
771,"Ordered Butter Chicken, Matka chicken and assorted breads.  Matka chicken - you won't find anything like this anywhere else in Delhi and this is a restaurant special dish. It has tandoori chicken, chicken kebabs, and egg all in with a very rich korma gravy and served in a earthen pot. The chicken was extremely tender and gravy was delicious. Quantity was excellent too.   Butter Chicken - eventhough Matka chicken stole the show, butter chicken was exactly how butter chicken should be. Tender chicken, buttery, rich and smooth gravy. Gravy was delicious and finger licking good.   Breads - ordered Garlic naan, laccha paranthas, missi rotis and normal naans. Breads were really crisp and thin. Garlic naan had great.flavour and healthy amount of garlic in it. Lacha paranthas were extremely soft and to die for.  Overall great experience and would definitely be reordering here.  Will give a try to their chinese options next time. Do give it a try for finger licking non pretentious food."
771,Been going to Krips since my school days with friends.Though the place is relatively small it makes up by serving some bomb food. The mughkai dishes have a very distinct taste and are not covered up with cream which a lot of restaurents do.The garlic butter naan paired with kadhai Chicken and shahi paneer is a killer combination. Would totally recommend this place.
771,The food was really good. It's a great place to sit and enjoy delicious food with your friends/family!
4234,"They rave about their hollandaise sauce and fries a lot, but when you eat them it is tasteless... I went with a lot of expectations of eating a very good eggs Benedict, but was sorely disappointed"
4234,Nice place for late night grab. Liked the mushroom soup and the vegetable burger that we had here sometime back. Loved the hussle bussle and the live music even at that hour of the day.. enjoyed my meal...
4234,"I am a regular visitor to Eggspectation & particularly like the buffalo tenderloin steaks. In fact I like almost everything I have ever tasted. However we had a horrible issue with the service last night. We had ordered - 2 salads (Eggspectation & Greek) and a soup (chicken) for starters & 4 dishes for main course (buffalo steak, chicken stroganoff, fish & chips and lasagna) . We had clearly told the waiter that we wanted to have the starters first & the main course later. However the main course came BEFORE we were even finishing our starters. This is very unfortunate. Why was your staff in such a hurry? It actually ruined and rushed our meal - in fact my steak wasn't even hot when it came, because it had been made earlier. To be honest, I do not believe that any other family has been visiting your restaurant as often as we have in recent times. This was a horrid experience.¬† Please admonish the staff members responsible & ensure that it never happens again.¬† Otherwise, we will stop coming.¬† I would normally give you 5 stars for the food - however I have just given 1 star because of what happened last night (24th August - Saturday)"
4234,"I went to this restaurant one fine morning for breakfast. Eggspectation looks exactly like a fine dining restaurant usually does- spacious, wide seating & warm lightings. I somehow loved the menu of this restaurant very much. The fresh juice section has a very interesting list of blends, all of which I wanted to try! Since I am a great sandwich lover, I just had to order the club sandwich. I would also like to point out, that the man waiting my table took all the effort to explain each and every item I pointed out.  I love eating lavish and extremely healthy stuff for breakfast.  Overall I had a great time savoring on my breakfast in Eggspectation, I would definitely like to visit this place again in near future."
4234,"Usually I ordered Chicken tikka and cold coffee.  But that day we had chicken satay, chicken tikka, pasta and hot coffee.  Ambienceüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü Food üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü Serviceüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü"
7352,No doubt garlic bread and stuffed garlic bread are the best of the menu. Must try their burger pizza as well. Had lovely time with the family and friends at almost all outlets of dominos.
5879,I had called at 9.22 pm @ 9313394221 (a number i got from the contact list of secular house canteen as shown by zomato) and placed the order at Secular House Canteen. The order that I received was from Mezbaan restaurant Munirka and in the bill the order timing is 17.33 pm where as i had placed the order at 9.22pm. The chicken dish whatever it was horrible and the tandoori roti were cold and dry. The chicken tasted horrible. It was not chewable. It was old. A total waste of money.
5879,"I have been eating here, and ordering from Mezbaan for over a decade now. Good taste, not too oily/spicy (unlike typical market food), within budget, quick delivery.  Dine-in is generally very crowded, and one has to wait a bit to get a seat, sometimes even on weekdays. A simple and average space.  Highly recommended for trial if you are in the area."
5879,"Most economy place in South Delhi which offers value for Ur bucks .Must try Tandoori chicken ,mutton saagwala and pineapple raita .service is prompt and courteous staff"
7391,The outlet is located at Vasant lok market This costa coffee is good for go to go coffee drinkers  I ordered a caffe latte and chocolate walnut brownie..! Food was worth money. Also the management is quite wonderful..!! Keep it up guys..!!
7391,"It was first time i have try Cappuccino from costa coffee and loved it. had Cappuccino and sandwich which was good in taste. Ambience was average, service was good. must try Cappuccino."
7391,this is the only place which has my kind of coffee. I always head to costa coffee to have some delicious coffee. the ambience of this place is really comforting and nice. The service is pretty good as well. the Belgian chocolate cookie frostino is one of the best cold coffee/shake i've ever had.
7391,"It is situated in basant lok market. It is a small place, but they have introduce a new menu in which you have lots of variety of food and drinks.It is a fun place to hang out with friends."
7391,"Caramel costa, the coffee it was not so good and no so bad.  It was ok‚Ä¶‚Ä¶¬†  their sevice was normally good.  ¬†It was not very hot but ok ok‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
3269,"I am coming from last fews year. In my opinion is this club One of the best club in Delhi.. Waiter service good, staff member is great . Servicing awesome, DJ great, food and drinks also great.and all members are very responsible and respected..they very well know how to treat new people when is coming."
3269,Worst place to do clubbing. Staff doesn't know how to behave with customers. Specially the person at the reception don't know how to greet the customer. If you are going there with your girl please think twice
3269,I visited this place on Sunday lunch. The place has dim lights and less crowd during daytime.   I ordered Virgin Mojito that was great in taste.   For food i had White Sauce pasta that was an average dish. The Veggie Pizza was bad in taste. Talking about Spring Roll it wass totally waste of money.  The Chilly mushroom was average in taste and chutney was not served.  We gave back Tandoori momos as they were burnt.  The good thing was staff was friendly and DJ was awesome.
3269,"hello RPM yesterday i went with my friend.  We ordered chicken wins with barbecue but they gave chicken Satay ü§îü§î I am cunnnfused Another server telling me that this is wins sir üò±. I am laughing and telling him sir "" ham Ali bagh se bhi aye "" We ignored I am eating but I know it's not chicken wings  After we ignored Bhatt brother apologize for this wrong order.  lots of enjoy chilllllll üç∫ beers, high volume sounds and with food .. excellent and energetic server ""bhatt"" good job keep it up üòçüòç .."
3269,After long time I went there.the priya P.V.R. was in renovation. No music like high price of menu.. Seems like i am sitting in a somewhere in a village not in delhiii. Guys kindly put the musuc its a bar. Change your host who standing in ground floor to assist the guest.. No courstsy.its humbale request to teach him how to behave if some one alone.
4501,"Paatra is a stone's throw from where I live, and a safe haven when it comes to taking someone out for a lunch or dinner treat. They have beautiful Indian veg and non-veg curries and appetisers, and the hassle of choosing what to order is eliminated because they have a buffet spread. So, you get to try a bit of everything (all their items are fantastic). The staff is very polite and they keep piling your plate with servings of kebabs and Indian bread. The only thing I'm not very satisfied is the dessert options - gulab jamun, fruits and an assortment of pastries - cliched. It would be better if they had more experimental and unconventional dessert choices too."
4501,"Paatra is one of the specialty dining restaurants at the well-known and strategically located Jaypee Vasant Continental. Having heard a lot of positive reviews about Paatra, I decided to pay a visit and dine at Paatra for lunch.¬†  Catering to Indian delicacies, Paatra has become one of favorites and top recommendations to relish quality Indian cuisine complemented by attentive service and attention to detail.¬†  Here's what I liked the most about my meal at Paatra.¬†  First things first, a welcome drink that paired Basil and Mint was presented as a refreshing start to the meal and the Amuse Bouche utilized the highly beneficial Makhana (lotus seed) and lotus stem to present a vibrant palate arouser.¬†  Among the appetizers, I relished the aesthetic yet delicious trio of Paratdaar Paneer (layered cheese), Dahi Aur Makhane Ki Shami (hung curd and fox nut) and Mattarwali Tikki (peas patty).¬†  For Mains, my favorites were Paneer Pyaz and Nadru Anjeer paired with a bread basket.¬†  And, the dessert was the ultimate - Indian elements presented in a chic way, with cut fruits on the side. Kulfi and Rasmalai together were good to delight my sweet tooth.¬†  I had a delicious meal at Paatra and would like to commend the team to keep their efforts going. :)"
4501,"Done up in amber and beige hues, Paatra is well-lit during the day, while soft lighting complements a flavorful meal during evenings. Ambient music recreating classical tunes from the rich symphonies closer to the mainland of India is the final touch that sets the mood right for a dining experience at Paatra. Read about my experience on the blog. :)"
4501,"Paatra is a place where passion is a scale higher to perfection. Because the human touch is more important in life to bring an extra piece of delight. And if you get that inner piece of delight, it automatically gets you a more beautiful and fulfilling world around you. That is the magic of Paatra. Now, that doesn‚Äôt mean that perfection is lesser than Passion. When it comes to food, presentation, innovation, and taste; Chefs have plenty of new ideas to play with. And each idea is a hit because of it getting curated and crafted in the best possible manner. There are two options for guest during lunch hours that end at 3 pm. These options are an exquisite buffet or an inquisitive a-la-carte choosing dishes of your choice and taste. But choosing the latter will devoid you of the fabulous variety of the former."
4501,"We went for a lunch buffet on a weekday. The buffet spread is very limited but at this tariff you also dont expect much. The major plus was their snacks which were too yummy , be it chicken tikka or fish fried. We also ordered them less spicy for our kid which they were happy to provide. They dont provide non veg option in soup and only veg soup is served. Desserts were a bit let down in terms of quality and taste. Overall an average experience. Does not make you feel to go again."
2870,I ordered veg manchurian. But i found that they had mixed chicken manchurian balls in veg manchurian. ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ very bad. They mixed up veg and non-veg..
2870,"I've been eating from this joint for over 20 years. The quality has always been consistent right from its early days as a food truck. The momos, chowmein and rolls are always made fresh and are very good. Though the momos are slightly more expensive than others they are bigger and size and the quality of the chicken filling is good. Their soups and gravy items are hit or miss. Excellent place to grab something spicy to go with your drinking session. Still don't know why they have a photo of a cake thoughüòÇ."
2870,The food is really tasty and regionable. Plsssz try their chicken chowmein.. it's delicious Delivery service is also good . Even the kathi rolls are very yummy
2870,"It's located near Udupi Restaurant close to main gate of DDA flats Munirka. Known for its Chinese food this van is famous for its paneer Kathi roll, chowmein , manchurian gravy. I must say it's half plate quantity of chowmein and Manchurian gravy is way too much to fill up your stomach. So think before you order a full plate.  Although I didn't like fried momos much. It has quite a fast home delivery service. And the staff is also friendly. Must try it's paneer Kathi roll I would recommend. They are my favourite üòç"
18383522,"The best place to order cakes for extra special occasions. The cakes are little costly than the rest of the world, but they are totally worth it. Fresh, good quality, soft, tasty - all that you would like the cake to make the occasion special.  Definitely recommended."
18383522,The establishment doesn't exist apparently.. Thats what zomato said when I ordered a dark chocolate muffin.. Weirdest order problem I faced so far :/
18383522,"Best place to have some extremely delicious deserts, you have got to choose from variety of desserts as the menu contains many types of dessert. I am uploading the picture which i have ordered kindly look at them. The taste of these things was great and the quantity was also sufficient. The quality was excellent and the price was also reasonable. Nice place to have some extremely delicious deserts. Must try."
18383522,It‚Äôs too costly for the quality and taste of the deserts. Disappointed with the taste. Only best thing is Zomato‚Äôs fast home delivery. Thanks Zomato
18383522,burnt cake.
311451,Subway serves a variety of subs and sandwiches. Their Chicken tikka sub is my favourite. Good quality
311451,"correct order was delivered. The bread, patty and sauces were not as per order!.........................................................................."
311451,Forgot to put the sauces I requested in my Subway sandwich and I didn‚Äôt receive any response after sending in a complaint. Food was dry and didn‚Äôt taste the way it should have. Unacceptable!
4621,Its a nice outlet for grocery shopping. Have went here many times. They also have bakery stuff. Pastries and variety of breads. A good place overall :)
4621,"The Christmas sweet pies were delicious. The filling  consisted dates, cherries and raisins and was sweet and rich with flavor. Just the treat to put one in the Christmas Mood."
4621,"Polite staff and nice cakes. The croissants also deserve a special mention , soft and flaky as they are supposed to be.   The cakes are balanced in taste and texture"
4621,The breads are fresh. All varieties of Breads are not available. Excellent selection of Cakes and Pastries. Staff are Courteous and friendly. Overall a good experience

300268,"I orderd the paneer lababdar, kadahi paneer Soya chanp and daal makhani. No taste was there in anything Any single dish was not tasty If there was an option below 0 I would have gone for that Suggested not to order from here. Feeling like Vomiting after eating the food"
300268,Delivery without any taping .how could we trust if this is fresh or not used by anyone . No salad or onions with order . Do not order food from this restaurant.
300268,Food taste is dull..mutton bhuna and chicken handi m natural meat ka taste hi nhi tha..bs onions and tomato ka paste ka wo n jala hua taste taste aa rha tha..its feel like i am eating tomato onion sabji..n chicken tandoori is ok but the pieces are very small m not even complete piece..when last time i ordered the pieces were large in size but now ek dm chote se toote phoote adhe se..call krne pr unhne 1 mint bat krke phn on krke side m rkh diya na koi answer na kuch..plla mehnge orders na kre chote mote kro ku ki food acha nhi h yha ka
300268,"Completly uncooked food...the spcies were undercooked, i could feel the granules in my hands of uncooked food....still my throat feels sore by eating so much of spices and that too uncooked."
4499,Had  snow peas and asparagus in white garlic Sauce... Fujian fried rice and Exotic veggies in Mahala sauce...... superb taste and service. Right guidance given by them to eat the best sellers there.
4499,"It's not a very popular choice when it comes to eating Chinese. But after my recent visit ,I have realised that this place serves great Chinese food.  Ambience is formal, vibes are good. The open kitchen with a long window just makes the whole experience of eating more vibrant.  Dimsums are good and so are the starters like the Guiyang Chicken and the Sliced fish Sichuan style. Thai Curry with Sticky rice was just amazing.  The place dies extremely good during lunch hours especially with guests from nearby Embassies and consulates, some if whom are loyalists."
4499,"Worth a trip to the place  Loved the place, it‚Äôs food and the staff and the manager all were great  Would definitely recommend the place to others"
4499,One of my favourite joints...why because the quantity is the best among all 5*. The waiters Vineet and Pankaj do an amazing job suggesting the right food and serving. Food tastes just too good. A must try for Indian Chinese fans. Prices are high but took 50% on girf.
4499,Ano tai is an authentic Chinese fine dining restaurant.I recently visited this place for lunch.It is set up beautifully and have a live/see through kitchen.We started our meal with corn kernels in salt and pepper.Very nice and crispy with no spices.Simple dish with basic ingredients.  Next we had chilli garlic noodles with saut√©ed beans.Chilly garlic noodles were perfectly cooked.They were spicy and not bland like other authentic Chinese restaurant serves.Beans on the other hand were also good.However I don‚Äôt like beans but these beans were lightly saut√©ed with a nice flavour of garlic.  Overall we had a good time.The food was good.Staff was friendly and well informed about all the dishes.
535,"A nice place to enjoy a quick cup of coffee before you start your day. Choice of foodstuff in the menu is lip smacking. I ordered red sauce pasta along with my favorite spinach corn sandwich, both are just too good. Wish to visit soon again."
535,"Went there for a brunch date with my friend, loved the ambience and the sitting arrangement is very cool. We ordered Apple crusher and cheese spinach corn sandwich with pasta. The portions are quite filling for 2 people. They were quick in service. I would like to visit again."
535,"A coffee place at Barista(vasnt vhir)Being a coffee lover I always wish to try at new places , so I went here to give it a try and the place had nice ambience with less people around We ordered cold coffee, white sauce pasta and Chicken dish. Pasta was tasty and coffee so yummy üòãüòã They have other Variety of snacks.  Good place to sit , nice music not that loud , yes can sit for couple of hours and enjoy the food.üòãüòã  The staff is helpful and serves properly. In all it was nice experience."
535,"The ambience of the place is awesome. The place is family and couple friendly. The food was also good. I tried coffee, cold coffee, sandwich. The taste was fine. I would recommend this place to everyone."
18247024,They serve rotis in the name of naan. Chicken was stale n over spicy and oily. Having stomach ache.
18247024,"No zomato gold, restaurant didnt allowed us to avail benefit and zomato behaved so irresponsible that as if gold is a free service like lunger. Mila to tumhari kismat, nahi to you can't even complaint. Bad experience"
310328,"The lemon coriander soup was really good, Chicken Tom Kha Phak Kai WAS UNBELIEVABLY GOOD. I had been searching for a good place nearby to satisfy my soup cravings and I have found it. I have tried other dishes from them in the past. Their food is really good. Keep it up!!!"
310328,"One of the hidden gems in South Delhi, Munirka. This place serves some of the best east asian and Indo-Chinese cuisine in south Delhi. Difficult to find as it is located in the small alley but worth the effort. Far better food than some of the posh ""chinese"" restaurants in town. Also the quality of ingredients (vegetables, chicken etc) used is really good. No use of cheap and rotten veggies to save money."
300275,It's a no fuss great family restaurant in South delhi. I don't who are the people criticizing it but it deserve to be in your wish list at least once...
300275,Very good food good service
300262,"Update: THEY ARE CLOSED FOR BUSINESS Love their hot dogs, even the veg ones :) The lady managing this stand is friendly. My only complaint is regarding their opening hours. Went there yesterday at 2 PM, but found it closed. This has happened earlier as well, not so often though."
300262,Located just opposite pvr priya. Next to the watch shop. This place serves decent dimsums. Oozy sausage tandoori roll is good. A good snack option. No sitting.
300262,"The best thing you could possibly have before you pop into Priya for a movie. Clean, good food though a bit expensive for what they serve. Both the hot dogs and momos are better than what you normally get around you."
300262,"Clean, hygienic, made with care, decent taste, wholesome, nutritious & mild spices. No frills but affordable & just right for a 'fast food' (as we call it) before or after a movie or in between shopping. Not recommended for those who prefer spicy, Indianised food though. Uncle Tom isn't one to go into great details or innovations. he sticks to the basics of steaming, boiling, sauces and fresh bread/rolls. Haven't had the pleasure of meeting him tho. Recommended for a quick bite."
300262,This is where to get some sausage quick fix. Sad that the other branch in Epicuria is closed.. It is one of my guilty yummy..others like chap sausage is also worth a try..
7240,"Good helpings and really really easy on the pocket..you won't get authentic Chinese but a decent version of the Indian Chinese that we like...opt for their chilly paneer gravy, chicken fried rice and schezwan veges...u will love it...good for on a budget..."
7240,The food could be better. But then again at that price it's actually reasonable. Just one suggestion though use less soya sauce. Last time my fried rice looks blackish because of that.
7240,We recently discovered this small place in Munirka. We ordered honey chilli potato and chilli garliv veg chowmin. Both were really good and portions were also fine.
7240,"We ordered Honey Chilly Potato, Veg Fried Rice and Veg Manchurian. Honey Chilly Potatoes were okay but were delivered cold. Manchurian needed a little salt, however, the portions delivered were generous."
7240,I just want to highlight an unethical practice of the owner. Owner sells cold drink for 15rs however the mrp is 12rs. Question is not about the 3rs. it is about the integrity.dont eat there period!
2122,The best chicken momos in Delhi. The chilli is to die for. I am a regular here and the quality has never gone down. The momos are completely hand made right there. Steamed or fried they are always brilliant. Must Must Must try!!!!
2122,such a pathetic packing ruined my food
2122,"The chicken momos are delish here üòç And the seating can be a hassle sometimes, you may or may not find a seat. Otherwise, pretty good. Recommend if you want to get some affordable bites."
2122,I ordered Chicken Momo. Taste can be rated as 3/5. One can have better momos for the same price. Some pieces weren't properly steamed. The chutney along was good. No mayonnaise.
3493,"A budget restaurant with average quality of food.....they serve North indian food, the quantity.is.very as compared to the prices...I tried shahi.paneer and naan....a normal budget restaurant."
3493,"Been to Dawat many times before 2-3 years, so this review is according to that time: taste was ok ok, quantity was good, prices were low. Don't think of it as a fine dine or luxury restaurant. Rather it is a budget restaurant with good food. Cleanliness needs to be maintained. Will soon visit again & update uüòâ"
3493,Hara bhara kabab is my most favourite dish of here. Really unique in taste. Other dishes are also amazing. Love to come here.it is really so fine and i like it very much.
3494,"Ratings for :- Butter chicken- 2.5 it wasn‚Äôt butter chicken at all -tasted like kadhai chicken with lots of gravy but nevertheless it tasted decent and for half a plate ,the quantity was huge Biryani chicken - 1 tasted nothing like biryani - was more like fried rice with chicken pieces. Plus for proportion that they offer- it wasn‚Äôt value for money   Rasmalai -4  Gulab jamun -3.5"
3494,"Visited the outlet as a part of Delhi tour .. a hole in a wall place with cramped seating area. This place is all ways full more with tourist than locals . Food wise it‚Äôs worth a try ... tried the tandoori chicken , butter chicken roti and plain rice . Taste wise no flaws abut cost bit on the higher side ..."
3494,A decent-pocket friendly option if you're planning a casual dine out with your friends or family. The non veg items are comparatively better but the overall service may disappoint you. would recommend eating here only if you somehow happen to be in this area and not worth travelling especially to eat over here.
3494,"Hot Chimney. This outlet is located in Khanna market, lodhi colony. Best place to enjoy with family and friends. Food was delocious in taste. Staff was very good and supportive. I tried:- afghani chicken, dal makhani, butter naan, chicken fried rice etc.  Must try.‚úî"
301654,"This is to inform all the Zomato users that if you ever wanna have AFGHANI CHAP at this Restaurant, Don't ever think of it. I warn you guys, literally don't ever think of it. It's so bad, infact worst, you guys are gonna curse yourself after having it. You'll hate the CHAP all your life if you gonna have it here.  Stay Safe Guys."
301654,"Though there ain't much of a dedicated seating for the restaurant but it does offer an ambience of the busy streets of Delhi. Food tastes good, you can actually taste the roots of Punjab the flavours have. A good place to stop for a satisfactory meal."
301654,"This restaurant is on the way to my home. So generally I take away the food. I gone this restaurant 3-4 times, order different-2 food, but I didn't liked any thing. Taste of Food are very bad. Service is too slow. Out door sitting. Didn't liked this restaurant."
301654,"Ordered tandoori chicken momos and mutton seekh wasn't good at all highly disappointed as I heard that the momos were good... Food is good as I have ordered sometime ,do try their peshawari dal which they don't make often now ... Cost for two :400 It's a takeaway joint"
301654,"Now I am writing this review after waiting for long and being reluctant to eat at peshwari.....But trust my words,I was really delayed it as the food from peshawari is really out of this world....whether it's no n veg or veg,you name it and they have it....Must try Tawa Chaap masala in red gravy,Paneer Butter masala,Chicken Changezi, Chicken Keema and Beryani !"
307692,Yummy Taste With Amazing Quality üëå
307692,A perfect place eatopia in indian habitat centre Lodhi road...for families...it has a variety of different types of menu ...is like a food court...where u get pizza's to butter chicken...under one roof....
307692,"One of the best place to have cafe Mocha coffee I can say with delicious truffle pastry we had last Sunday , it's a good coffee n lil bakery at eatopia In indian habitat centre , We also had tried icream sunday name waa niker boker , very yummiest , it reminded me of my childhood days Bec of toffee sauce in it  Must visit place"
307692,A nice place in the habitat centre to have desserts. A total hit with the kids..especially in summer. They have a vast variety of coolers...milkshakes...cold coffee etc. All good. The desserts are too rich for my taste though. I've had the chocolate cake and black forest pastry. Both had a generous helping of cream frosting which I felt was lil extra sweet. The whipped cream on the black forest was thick n fatty . The proportion of frosting to cake should be better thus enhancing the taste of the cake.
307692,"I had looked up this place on Zomato before coming here. The creme caramel looked delectable from the pictures and I ordered the same. They had a seasonal variation with mangoes and kafir lime. I ordered a cappuccino to go with it. To my disappointment, both the items were average. I might try something else when I come here next time."
307694,A good place for kids . There is an outdoors play area nearby too. The fries here are good . The pizzas are filling and decent for the prices. The chicken nuggets are tasty though u might occasionally find the insides slightly uncooked. The nuggets are minced chicken cutlets coated with bread crumbs and deep fried!!
307694,Sadly the worst Pasta of my life. I am of the belief that one can never go wrong in cooking pasta but I was wrong. It felt like uncooked tomato sauce and bland with strange after taste. The soup was equally tasteless. It felt a waste of money and could't even meet half my appetite. Will never eat here again. :(
307694,"Good place. It is located inside Indian Habitat Centre Decent food.   Very very cost friendly.  Loved the burger, naanza and the pie.  Do give this place a try"
18438416,Another place joining the bandwagon of Corona- so anything goes! Probably the best lamb burger I have had in home deliver... Amazing chicken burger... But pink gamble pasta ... A little dry..  The worst thing is....like my experience in 2 other places since Corona... Restaurants seems to think it's ok to deliver WHATEVER is available....cz customers aren't going to complain.... WELL I ORDERED A CHEESECAKE and I got a FRIED OREO CHEESECAKE!
18438416,Very poor customer service and delivery. Simply not acceptable to promise 30 mins or free then not deliver order. Request for refund rejected. Do not order from this shambolic and poorly run ‚Äòservice‚Äô.
18438416,Took two hours to deliver two sandwiches .. very bad service
18438416,"I ordered a veg burger and sandwich on 27th Sep 2019 for lunch and I must say that the Sandwich was Ok, nothing great but not bad but the burger was the worst I had in the recent time. It was so damm oily, the party was burnt and the worst one can expect. I am super disappointed and not going to order from this place again. I raised a complaint as well with ZOMATO team and they were very helpful. Zomato must schedule a hygiene visit to the restaurant as this is the worst experience in the recent time."
313280,It's one of the hidden gems. Amazing pizzas and ice creams. They have really different flavours and everything is made in house! They have a decent coffee machine. They also have lots of board games. Which is a lot of fun!
313280,"Absolutely in love with the ice creams at #bhane!! The flavours are spot on and each one is better than the other!!! üòçüòçüòç  What I loved?!! The menu is limited to 4 ice creams and each flavor is a #foodies delight! The 4 flavours are #strawberryGoatCheese #saltedCarmel #cocoaChocolate and #peanutButter. I loved all 4 and would recommend the combination of peanut butter with chocolate cocoa üíÅüèºüíÅüèº  Price points- 100 for a single scoop, 150 for two scoops üôÖüèºüôÖüèº  They also have #videoGames and #boardGames. I played #battleship with a friend and didn't realise where the time flew. In love with this place. P.s:- won't recommend their pizzas, splurge on their ice creams only!!üç®üç®"
313280,It's a very spacious cafe where you can work or have a good coffee date or may be spend your time eating cocoa coffee ice cream playing various games from their collection.
313280,"Concept of this outlet is pretty interesting. It's more of a retail store with limited food menu (coffee, ice creams and pizzas) but the good thing is whatever they do have is great.   Ice creams are creamy, flavoursome and delectable. Absolutely loved the salted caramel ice cream. We tried their cappuccino which was also made well. Unfortunately, the store gets closed at 7 30 or so."
313280,"I Love this place. I love bhane clothing. I love sneakers at veg non veg. But I was surprised when the pizzas were able to make me fall in love with them too! And the food is super affordable! I ordered the olive-jalape√±o and the vegetariana pizzas plus 2 cold coffees and the bill only amounted to Rs. 900! Even domino's would have set me back more for pizzas of the same size. They have board games and all the good ones which makes it ideal for fun, no-pressure dates! Will be visiting again soon during the hot summer days for their ice-cream."
18279453,"This place has been shut down. I hope the information goes up soon, we spent a lot of time looking for this place but couldn't find it because of the same."
18279453,Pancakes were amazing ¬† ordered for 2 cold coffee also¬† Clean ambience  Good to hangout with friends and family  A small gift as their famous chocolates is very amazing.....
18279453,"Ordered crepes, waffles, and a pizza.The crepes  and the waffle were good enough and just as you expect them to be.The crepes were soft and the chocolate and nut topping on the waffle made it taste  good.The pizza on the other hand was not as you would expect it to be and was a major let down."
18279453,"Service was not fast. It was too slow. And specially, their   drinks were also not good it was tasted like as water.   Pancakes were lightly good of taste. Their packaging was just ok, not very fine."
18279453,"Celeste is famous for its chocolates.   Choco chip pancake with Nutella and whipped cream- the ONLY best thing we tasted from our order.   Paprika soya sausage, roasted pepper onions pizza: more of a crunchy flat 'papad' than a pizza.   Spicy tomato, herb and cheese pasta: had better flavoured pastas than this. Not lived up to its reputation.   So overall was good experience."
18245249,I usually go to this place for momos and sometimes for main courses whenever I do not have mood to have homemade food. This place in LaxmiBAI nagar market.   Seating in outer space Food wise it is nice place Services are quiteate though the food is freshly prepared.
18245249,"Not a very clean or awesome place, but the food was good..taste was great and includes in a low budget restaurant,, Tried Afghani Chicken momos and Tandori Chicken momos which were great.. steam Chicken momos was also good."
307693,"The quality at oriental lee has really deteriorated. I tried  the thukpa,which tasted of soupy maggi ( it seems they had literally used the maggi powder). Someone really needs to look at the quality of food they are serving at prices they charge."
307693,"Eatopia is a pocket friendly food court with separate counters for Indian street food, North Indian Food, Chinese/Thai, Continental ie pizzas burgers etc. I had the Indian Chaat, Gol Gappas, Pao Bhaji, Chole Bhature, Momo's, Spring Roll, Sesame Chicken, Banoffie pie, Americano. Its great to be able to have so much variety under one roof, Its well maintained neat and clean. The only dish I found fault with was the Pao Bhaji. The Pao ie bread was dry, so the Chef kindly replaced it with Chole Bhautre.¬†  While I was there with my family I saw a lot of friends, families celebrating birthdays, getting a cake from their bakery or just enjoying the ice creams.¬†"
307693,A decent place. The food is what you'd expect from a street food place .. doused heavily with ajinomoto and salt . Not much variety though . Just the regular dishes.
307693,One of the best for Chinese. Inside best food court in south Delhi eatopia. One of the best for Chinese. Inside best food court in south Delhi eatopia.
1917,One of the best bakery shop in lodhi road. This place situated in the starting of the meharchand market. I tried Chocolate and butterscotch pastry. It was really good. Looking forward to try some more dishes.
1917,Gopala is my favourite place to have huge chaina sweet called a Rasgula.  Their size is huge and it is so spongy and gooey at the same time.  Totally love it.  Their quality of sweets is very satisfactory.  Quantity is good too.
1917,"Absolutely the best rasgullas in Delhi. Not too sweet & the right squeaky, soft texture. Highly recommended. But get there in time - they sometimes get sold out."
1917,This is a bakery shop in lodhi colony...you can try pastries or cake from here...but they are very expensive according to me....tthe quality and quantity of food doesn't satisfy the price..
18027962,"Me and my friend were walking down the Meherchand Market Lane and spotted   this petite Italian restaurant in the corner. So we decided to go in and try a pizza. We ordered the Chicken Supreme Pizza. It was pretty good but sort of Indianised in taste. The pizza was oven baked, thin crust, cheesy and the topping was great! I will come back to try the tempting-looking dessert and bakery items. The decor is sweet and subtle and the prices are pocket-friendly."
18027962,"Cute coffee shop, Just about space for may be 8-10 people to sit.  Coffee shop in lower basement in lodhi market. Very little menu, cute granny English set up. Decent service.. Loved their coffee but the jalape√±o paprika garlic bread was not a great item on their menu.. The coffee and biscuits were nice !"
18027962,"A small cosy bistro to have a good cup of cappuccino,it doesn't follow the same way with the food. Food is quite average. But if one needs to take his beloved for a flowery romantic date,then a good heads-up."
18027962,Charming interiors. Cozy cafe. Blueberry smoothie was delicious and sandwich was very good. What impressed me most was the service. Pawan was just so sweet. Next time will try their Italian food.
18027962,"This was my second Visit here.At my first visit i didn't know the name of the ""ristornate"" :) ¬†but i was impressed alot with its interior and the food served so thought i could give it a try for my next visit. ¬†  I found this restaurant while walking down the street and decided to meet an old friend here for an evening snake time coffee.We were just crossing by it and jumped in.   Its a pretty small place  The place has got a lovely positive vibe to it and has got Light and colorful ambiance.  I love it for its simplicity and yet so stylish.  This is a good place for Italian food and I love their pasta mediterraneo,alla supreme,pollo,funghi and bescimella,in beverages coffe served with a biscuit cake,in my first visit it wasn't served might they have introduced as a complimentary along with it.  I have also tried their smoothies:-  summer berry love(OK),bannana cinnamon(Good) and bailey's irish cream (worst).  A saviour in Lodhi Colony.I would prefer this place for a catchup with friends.Nice and cozy place we have now in Lodhi Colony.  Decently priced."
9316,Don't go ever here. It doesn't deserve to be in a colony as posh as lodhi colony. They will serve you food Cooked two days ago and tell you it's totally fresh. Horrible service and terrible food.
9316,Food quality was worst owner lady (fatty) was super rude and his brother chashmish was acting fool..
9316,The food was pathetic i don't want to give this restaurant not even a single star. Bad experience. Bangla Sweet Corner.neva eva order from here .
1407,"This place had no sitting arrangement when i went there so do not expect that it will always be available. I had tikki chole bharure and golgappe. Everything was nice considering the prices, except gol gappe. Overall you can go there if you want to eat snacks."
1407,Visited here ...just a average restaurant.. This restaurant is used to good and famous for their sweets(because there is no other sweets shop) in Lodi road....but nowdays the quality decreased...the behaviour of the staff is very rude....a big no for this restaurant.
1407,Awesome samosas and bread pakoras ...very delicious crunchy..and there were two Chutneys ..both were very tasty..Ganesha restaurant is famous for sweets in Lodhi road..
1407,I ordered chole bhature...and that is .not even close to good.......too spicy ...and flavour of chole is very bad...chole is not mixed properly with all the masala..........and then ordered some samosa and bread Pakora and paneer pakora ..samosa is average ..but you can go for paneer pakora which is very good.
1407,I ordered aloo tiki and dahi bhalla from this outlet . Both d dishes have gud taste . I liked d chat . They have gud counter of chat and evening snacks .
307695,"As I went there today, there was some special banarasi delicacy being served!! It depicted banaras in cafe it was so delicious!!!"
307695,"Located at the main cafeteria of Indian Habitat Centre, has huge variety of snacks and beverages. I ordered Bun Tikki, Bombay bhelpuri and Shikanjvi. I liked Bun Tikki of all the items, it made me remember my childhood fav food and it was very authentic and delicious. A must try!"
307695,"Looking for something chatpata ? They offer every type of chaat, panipuri, sevpuri, bhalle papdi, chhole bhature etc with lassi, rasmalai etc. Good food and customer service with friendly atmosphere ."
307695,"Ambience - 8.5   Food - 9.0 Service - 9.5 Value for Money - 9.0 We ordered dilli ki papri chaat. The taste was perfect. Papri chaat¬†is my favourite dish, and I know how it tastes. Chaat here is just awesome."
307695,I ordered Lucknow chat and Delhi chat.. The Lucknow chat is spicy and Delhi chat is sweet. Then we had sweet which was a mix of 5 small gulab jamun and rabri. food court is clean and tidy. Service is prompt. The food goes easy on pocket.
3497,I ordered lemon chicken from this place and food was well prepared and was higenic and delicious too would prefer next time as well To my people
3497,"I had pork salami(4/5), ham(4.5/5), cheeze pizza(4/5), undoubtedly taste was worthy, people are gentle, rate is both-average & costly, depending upon pocket you can buy food cuisines here. Only take away is available in this outlet. Last picture was self made...üòÅ"
3497,Name one thing that isn't amazing here !love the chicken sandwich  .is equal parts cheesy and tasty ! Should try seekh kebab sandwich too! Super pocket friendly
3497,"Very bad quality and contains expiry food We bought a veg sandvich from green chick chop lodhi colony which is stinking badly and even the taste is too bad, when we complaint to the owner he simply denied it by saying its ur choice you take it or not but we will sell like this only Too bad experience"
3497,"Want a lip smacking chicken snack, I don't think one has to go far. The sandwich is created to be divine, one of the finest I have had. Rest of the snacks are a good value for money and rather makes your day. Just grab a pack and start munching on the go along with its raw meat and loads of other stuff it's surely is a great outlet"
18472648,This place has great service. Super nice and delicious food.. Came here for a quick lunch bite and got our food really quickly. Got the mushroom & Corn pasta and it was really good. Definitely will come back if in the area.
18472648,"The place was closed. We went for Sunday breakfast, found the place was closed. Quite disappointing for someone who plans the day around meals :)"
18472648,"It is one of the most prettiest place I have been to , the atmosphere is so calm and relaxing  I enjoyed my CAPPUCCINO coffee and garlic bread with spicy dip . I did not try anything else as I did not plan to come here but I would certainly come here again as my first experience was very good"
18472648,"Ambience : Cozy european era inspired ambience making it a delight venue for casual conversation. The white rose wall, tiny bird cutlery, micro lights all add to the charm of english serinity.  Cuisine : Have vivid options for casual snacking as well as hi tea.Over all the cuisine is palatable. Pizzas are delicious. However pastas can be improved.  Service : Staff is active and quick in service."
18472648,The food here is amazing. Every dish has a different taste of it's own! The mushroom and spinach quesadillas and the dark chocolate shake are a must try! Also the pastries are yum! Best place for vegetarians.
18346857,Never visit here..
18346857,We tried the Chicken-Mo-Biryani and it was lip smacking spicy biryani I had. This fusion dish is a must try but less quantity as compared to price.
18222557,"A unique concept, an . Loved the chicken dish and the dessets too! Super cool staff, comfortable seating and totally worth the money spent ¬† Simply loved the place ! Will go again !   We started with the yummiest food"
18222557,"I have been to this place few times and every time it lives upto my expectation. the ambience and food are really very good.¬† the place is located at a very convenient location with ample parking space. the only worrying part is the lack up customer visiting this place, which makes me feel how long can this continue like this.¬† Apart from this full marks for the service and food, they ever served us palak corn, which I loved from the earlier visit, but now out of the menu. would love to visit again."
18222557,"We dined here for lunch after being taken here by our taxi driver and without a doubt probably earnt himself commission as this was our most expensive meal of our trip.   The ambience was very nice, the decor and layout was very clean and welcoming. The staff are very pushy from the time we arrived, and when we left  We started with the paneer tikka, which was well below average for the price, lacked flavour and the paneer had a rubber-like texture.  The Gosht Rogan Josh should be renamed to Bone Rogan Josh as there was literally one spoonful of meat that could of been rescued. It was pathetic.  A meal for two of us came to about 2,500rs which is ridiculous for the quality of food and experience.  Would not recommend."
18222557,Best place for north indians and chicken lovers. Sitting arrangement was decent Food is good so is the service...quantity they serve is too much... So that should be kept in mind before ordering food...we went on a Sunday so we had to wait for a long time but that was ok as the area outside is really nice with fountains... Food was worth the wait... Overall nice place... his is one of those restaurant which I can't get tired of no matter how many times i visit this place. The food quality is superb and every dish has different flavour & taste. The quantity is good too and the service is the best you can expect from a busy restaurant like this..
18436483,"I found this concept quite interesting. I have ordered in bulk and the packaging was very creative. If I talk about the taste, it is outstanding. This time I have ordered for Raksha bandhan and it is a very good concept for gifting on special occasions. My siblings loved it a lot.  It was a basket full of chocolates, brownie and chocolate popcorn  Oreo Brownie was like‚Ä¶.yummmmmmm‚Ä¶..i can‚Äôt tell it just melted in my mouth.  Chocolate bars ‚Äì I have ordered butterscotch and nuts, they were awesome.  Choco popcorn- o yes it was something very new and interesting for me.  Anyone who want fresh home made bakery products, Baked & Wrapped is the Bestttt.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
18436483,Does not picking up phone. Why d hell zomato register them. I tried 3 times. No courtsey. I would recommend to remove them from here. It is completely waste of tym
18436483,In horn Ok Fest we ordered red velvet pastry and Choco shot... both are dammmm amazing. Red velvet is awsum worth it. Their service is good and polite too.
18436483,"I stumbled across the Instagram page of this beautiful little home bakery and soon noticed that they are on zomato as well and are operating on quite a big scale!! I was instantly drawn and wanted to give this place a try. The bakery delivers straight to your doorstep and the packaging of the items were very cute!  So i ordered:  - Devil‚Äôs food cake: The chocolate on this was so good that i cant even stress it enough!! It was not overly sweet and had the perfect balance! You can feel some sugar granules in it but thats exactly how its supposed to be!!  - Chocolate Cheese Cake: okay, i cant stress enough how much i loved this and to what extent i want to recommend this to all you guys! This was one of the best cheesecake i have ever had and thats a huge statement as i have literally tried cheesecake from so many places!  Overall, i would highly recommend the chocolate cheesecake without a doubt! Love it!  Malika xx"
310305,"Chicken Momo's are awesome, and loved chicken chowmein."
310305,"I ordered chicken white sauce pasta from china hut through zomato,,¬† they delivered me pasta with very little white sauce showing,, not cooked well, even they not give any sauce white white sauce pasta,, see on image.. I called owner of china hut, They not accept their mistake... Don't order from china hut, worst experience .."
18337922,Ordered a cake for my friend's birthday last week. It was just fabulous. Could not believe that someone can make somethings that special from home bakery. 10 out of 10.
18337922,"We ordered the KitKat and Gems cake for my daughter's birthday. This is the first time we ordered a cake from here but I must say we weren't disappointed. The delivery was timely, packaging was excellent and cake was quite spongy and delicious. But what stood out the most was the personalized message and a flower that came along with the cake, which really was quite thoughtful. My daughter loved it! Even after refrigeration, the cake didn't become hard and was quite spongy. I strongly recommend Cake Me Up to people residing in and around Jungpura especially. It is a must try!"
18337922,An amazing place and amazing cakes... i love thier cupcakes a lot... they are a delivery only outlet but i hope they open a bakery soon. Great going
18337922,"It was my best friend's birthday and I had to order her favorite cake for her. So I started looking for places on zomato and came across  *Cake Me Up*. I was a little reluctant to order from this place at first because I had never heard of it before but my, oh my...They delivered  PERFECTION! I had ordered a BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE and I loved that cake so much that I could've married it if it was a person! The delivery was on time and I loved the presentation and packaging of the cake. For all foodies, people with a sweet tooth, people not with sweet tooth, basically everyone, I strongly recommend this place. You must try it! Their desserts are not just mouthwatering but also have value for money. MUST TRY!"
18337922,"A delightful experience!! I ordered a red velvet cake through a recommendation from my friend. All I can say is, it was utterly delicious !! I was really impressed with the texture, smoothness and the taste of the cake. My guests loved it!!! Moreover, the person who spoke with me over the phone was extremely professional with respect to the delivery timeline and the packaging and presentation standards. I was surprised the way he attended to my queries with utmost attention to details. The box was very impressive. For those (sweet tooth addicts) , I would sincerely recommend to try this outlet at least once. You are in for a surprise!! Team Cake Me Up!! Great work. You have long way to go.... Welcome to the competition!!"
7892,"I had cheese pizza, paneer patties, chocolate truffle pastry, pudding there. It was reasonably good, no siting there. You can also have chicken roll outside there shop."
7892,"The owner has no ethics or manners regarding how to treat a customer or talk to the customer. You purchase a product from there and in case you go back to return/exchange it, the owner will be like - ""bhai kaha se aya hai? Ja yaha se.. ye yaha se nahi liya tune."" (even though you've purchased that product just a couple of minutes ago), so better always take a #Bill from them for every purchase."
18322676,"One of the oldest Ice cream joints in Delhi. It continues to keep its reputation of being one of the best. Had Hot chocolate fudge (my all time favourite) and Mango scoop , They have tasted same since the day I have first tasted them 7 years ago. Thx Giani's for all these Icy moments."
18322676,This place is very famous for its kulfi faluda and their wide varieties of ice creams and sundaes Quality is best Quantity is decent Prices are also decent
18322676,"Mango sundae @ Giani's, Delhi  Taste - 5, Quantity - 4, Quality - 5, Hygiene - 5, Service - 4, Ambiance - 3  Verdict - Must Eat This  Giani's always had been my Go-to dessert place. In the summers, they find these extremely luscious mangoes. Then they make a heavenly sundae with vanilla icecream & fruit syrups. This is a must-have if you have a sweet tooth."
18322676,"Giani's is one of the most famous icecream palor in delhi. It has number of branches delhi. It currently holds 61 outlets out of which i went to Giani's situated in jangpura. Giani's is known for its desserts, ice cream etc.  What I had ?  -Choco nutty cone : Chocolate with nuts made a awesome flavour in the mouth.Nuts were all over the icecream . Icecream had a great combination of crunch and nuts Was very good to had it.  Perfect place for those who loves Icecream .  Ratings - 8.5/10"
310101,"This is an Afghani restaurant in bhogal, jangpura..I had their Afghani burger ..Honestly, nothing special about this burger stuffing is very dry need to add some sauce in it ..Not recommended!!"
310101,"Their food is something which is totally different in the town from the rest.! Its just okay for me but yeah it's food is worth giving a try.! Had burger over here and it gave a complete different meaning to the term ""burger"" that's why I am considering that their food is different."
310101,"Excellent food. Had the Qabuli Uzbeki. Huge portions - had difficulty eating it all. And endless cups of green tea to wash it all down with. Nice ambience too.¬†  Reminded me of Afghanistan where I worked for a year. One thing I can say is that both the ambience and the food are authentic, exactly the same way you would find in Afghan cities. The practice of drinking green tea along with your food is also typically Afghan."
310101,"Had this cray burger at Pakeeza..  Great Quantity at an affordable price. The aroma from the restaurant calls you from Outside. A must try for folks who like Afghani Food.. Service, Staff and owner are so sweet and welcoming!! üòç"
310101,"The best wasabi value for money in Jangpura. The chicken roast is slow cooked, served whole, soft and juicy with fries and naan. another recipe works out well with minimal spices and that is the pulao. Even the mutton tikka is better than the one served mughlai if you want it less fiery on the tongue."
7891,Very very bad food. Please Don't buy food from here. I will never buy from here. Very bad quality food. Also they are SUPPLYING very small quantity of my order food. Just one fourth of my order food.
7891,"Aggarwal sweet India, jangpura  Gol gappe - 8/10 Papdi chat - 7/10 Dhokla - 8/10 Khandvi - 7/10 Namak paare - 9/10  The shop is just fine and on the main road. Not much clean but okish. Delivery is too quick. Taste of items is overall good. Place may be maintained to something bette.  Overall - 8/10"
7891,This place is not your regular joint to visit for an outing but a saviour in terms of getting food delivered in quick time  Gol gappe - 8/10 Papdi chat - 7/10 Dhokla - 8/10 Khandvi - 7/10 Namak paare - 9/10  The shop is just fine and on the main road. Not much clean but okish. Delivery is too quick. Taste of items is overall good. Place may be maintained to something bette.  Overall - 8/10
7891,When we hear the name of Agarwal the sweets n snacks use to come in our mind. Bought some Imarati and gujjian from agarwal sweets. The taste of gujjian was good n the taste of Imartis was just ok ok and I felt that these were not fresh. Ambience of the shop was ok ok. There was lot of smoke n smell aggarbattis n which deteriorates the taste of the food.
7891,"A small sweet shop with a variety in indian mithai(s) serves an average quality food. I have been to this outlet multiple times and the quality keeps changing. The latest i had was a kachori-sabzi - the highest level of spices, made me sweat in the first two bites. The same i had another day was quite good to eat. Besan ke laddoo are always good however. Quality of other indian desserts vary as per the chef's mood ;)  Being located in a residential area, this shop surely comes to the rescue if you have guests at home and don't have time to cook. People looking for a consistent quality will be disappointed."
18313115,amazing
18313115,"I loved samosa, Pani Puri, bhalla papadi and jalebi of this shop amazing in taste really only complaint is that Zomato listing prices are higher than shop prices but it works because travelling cost from lajpat Nagar to jangpura is more than the difference"
18313115,"This is a very old and well known shop in bhogal. It is near my house so i have tried almost everything! And it is amazing! A perfect breakfast is their cholle puriü§ó I would recommend this place to everyone if you are around. DO TRY their sweets which are so rich in flavors and also samosa! Now they also have a sitting area, so its better if u eat their as the freshness and hotness of the food increases its tasteü§ó"
3681,very bad.. taste..
3681,stinky and rotten kebabs...chicken roll full of onions...very bad food. had to throw it away
3681,this time delivery is before time  i will rate 5 star for delivery
3681,"I will order from here they said malai kofta is finish yet ,, order someting or wish to take ur money back,, i said i pay 270rs online then my order was come 180rs they not give my money back in zomato credit......"
3681,Food is horrible over here. Only visited this place when there was no any option left. I must say they really need to improve their food quality and hygiene.
308488,"Cheap and tasty snacks, they have a wide range of chicken items ranging from raw to heat and eat items. Chicken sandwich, burger and cheese sausages are my favorites. The portions size is quite good, filling and tasty but most of the time they don't have everything available, the servers are confused and they take a minimum of one hour to deliver the food, even though the distance is less then 1km. The delivery time and un - availability of all food items make it an average place."
308488,Very difficult to reach the nos. if you want to place an order in the morning- they either don't pick up or its unreachable. If one can reach them then its good but they really need to improve their answeriung service
308488,This place is good for all those frozen stuff and raw chicken they also have ready to eat snacks they are also good but there is no place to sit so better to take them away
308488,"A superb place to get frozen cuts,  if u dislike the butchers come to Green chick chop.  Various varieties of frozen foods available marinated in different spices. Bought whole chicken from them it was very fresh and after cooking it i found it became tender easily.  They have readymade fast available too like pizza,  kathi rolls and burgers.  The easy,  best way of getting raw,  fresh yet varietyful frozen stuff.  Service : 3.5/5 Quality : 3.5/5 Value for money : 3.5/5 Ambience : 3.5/5"
308488,"The quality of the stuff has and is very good! But the service in particular home delivery needs alot of improvement. The person attending the phone doesn't understand half of what you say. Then they commit 30 minutes and when you call them after 35 minutes of placing your order, very casually you are told that the boy is yet to leave with the delivery. When you try to reason, the person hangs up the phone.¬†  So yeah... bravo with the food as well as the service!! (Pun intended)"
310469,Delivery service is very poor. Restaurant people not at all professional. No sense of responsibility for the orders  once confirmed. Lack of coordination and Communication amongst team.
310469,"So we were searching for a place to have a quickie near Jangpura and found this outlet. The hunger level was not roaring, so ordered just the Chicken Lollipop initially. We were served with it after around 10 minutes and I was disappointed just by the sight of our food. Chicken lollipops were all soaked in oil (I know that's a fried item, but those were really wet and shining). Gathering all the guts I had, picked up a piece and let it go in the mouth, just because of a thought that the taste would be good. But I was proved wrong and it tasted equally bad. Didn't have much strength left to order anything more so decided to leave immediately. Though this place has a gamut of frozen food items, which even is loved by many, this is not that ideal place to have a quickie prepared by them in store. What we recommend is, buy the frozen packs, take them home, and prepare yourself. Cheers!"
310469,"One more place to get ready to eat, raw chicken in jangpura area, but just an average store, they too don't have all products available which are on the menu, i tried the chicken salami which was bad and looked rotten, never ordered from them again and would always prefer sardar or green chick chop."
310469,Very bad quality of raw chicken. Such a reputed outlet & this is the quality. It was frozen stale & very greasy. Will never order again. You need to improve your standards or just shut down.
310469,A good outlet to get some ready to eat stuff...i bought chicken seekh kabab and chicken sausages from here...they were quite good at decent prices means cheaper as compared to Venkys and Yummies... they also have some cooked stuff like grilled chicken and some rolls which they prepare at their outlet have never tried them but they seem quite delicious and hygienic from outside...
18355110,I ordered chicken wings. Taste so awesome. Staff behavior so good. Delivery so fast. Packing so good. Evey dish taste so awesome. Cheap and Best. Plz try itt
18355110,"Amazing food‚ô•Ô∏è.. menu is perfect , something for everyone . Service was awesome .. will be back definitely üòçüòç.. amazing food in very less prices"
18355110,Very tasty starters. All chicken items are amazing. And good young guys doing a pretty decent job. Will suggest others to try. Never knew such a good eatery exist in this area
18355110,Naan were like rubber. Not good. Chicken is good.
18355110,We tried the chicken roll. A little unhygienic place and it is prepared unhygeinically. Chicken roll tastes good with the chutney. A small place only takeaway.
18243438,Pathetic food here for sure. Ordered their tandoori soya chaap and Paneer tikka. Didn't like it at all. I donot recommend this place. Bakwass khana. Who puts Mayo in tikkas.
18243438,"I dont like the chaap it was toooo spicy they have reduced their quality so all items i ordered is not good in taste i dont like please ,l,."
9568,i have order a dal makhni and naan . dal makhni was awesom and rich i can feel the flavor or pure deshi ghee and naan was good looking forward to order again over all great experience......
9568,Its a nice place you can try their butter chicken thats nice and chicken tikka thats all what i have tried but will order something again for surethere
18357554,Beatiful place to relax and having delicious food item with great service  Interior and exterior decorations are just awesomeüòçüòòüòò  Must Visit¬† Tawa chicken and Tawa fish üëå üëå  Service - 4.5/5  Packaging - 4/5  Taste - 4.5/5  Value for Money - 4/5  Overall - 4.5/5
18357554,"A must recommended restaurant for non-vegetarians, i personally love their fish items like tawa fish and fish masala, other than that keema kaleji and gurde kapoore is very yummy."
18357554,it was pathetic
18025100,I order chicken steam momos and chicken fry momos they mention 10pcs in one plate but they only give 7pcs in fry momos and 8pcs in steam momos
18025100,Ordered chicken momos and chicken spring rolls. Received half the quantity of spring rolls. The momos were just maida and the stuffing of chicken was not properly cooked and was raw.  Didn‚Äôt like it at all. Packaging was super bad too. Not recommended at all.
18025100,The owner has no respect. He is rude and pathetic service. No hospitality and doesn‚Äôt have the etiquettes. A big time looser
18357562,"Butter Chicken is very hard, totally lost money, almost all chicken half cooked... I don't understand my friend totally upset. Please next time don't do again."
18357562,"Simple yet one of the most delectable taste in town. Personally with a special corner for soya chaap rolls, this place, commonly referred to as Bawarchee, is a must to go place for anyone looking for paneer, soyabean, chicken mutton or fish tikka. Have my word. You are going to bless me in the future.  Change in location - now available near INOX jungpura"
18357562,"Best taste for tandoori stuff in jangpura no other place serves such fresh taste , love this place lyk anything , best tandoori chicken n chicken tikka roll"
18453186,It's cheating in the name of (kailash colony) sanjha chulha. Ordered by mistake. Food was smelly and not fresh. Pathetic.
18453186,Pretty average mutton roll incomprison to Kailash colony outlet food. Very spicy and not so fresh. I should have placed order from other branch.
18453186,It's cheating by the name of sanjha chullha of Kailash colony
18025096,I luv their food...I have ordered Malai Kofta and Dal makhni..Taste was good at a reasonable price..Bt they send me Dal tadka Instead of Dal Fry..Nd the tawa roti was Chewy.
18025096,Awesome food veg malai chap &non veg Afghani chicken is very yummy all  food is good  & important thing less delivery timing  food delivered only 20  to30 minutes 1more thing  reasonable price for all food
18354663,The onion chicken seekh kebab is a must must try. Look no further if you want fresh and healthy mutton. Serves heat and eat products too. Try.
18354663,"Better then republic of chicken, they have a variety of products, my personal favorite are the onion chicken seekh kebab, the server was quite friendly and helped me in deciding what i wanted, but again the unavailability of all products make it an average and not so good shop."
310468,I have tried their chicken biryani...the quality was just about ok...though very pocket friendly considering the quantity of the biryani...their location is also pretty good but still i thinl the outlet is struggling to get recognition in market for among non veg foodies...i just hope they will be able to do it...
3635,Quality of food is very poor ...the chef's did not know how to cook chicken they serve you as raw they got from market very unhealthy..
3635,"The taste was not so good. Blant,. Quantity is also a concern, packaging do not expect proper packaging. Still will tey ro five it another chance"
309737,It's a must try place for all foodies. I ordered golden fried prawns and chilly chicken gravy. The flavors were upto the mark and the food was finger licking delicious. Food was delivered hot and packed up properly. Highly recommended
309737,I've tried their fried rice and hakka noodles. Both tasted so amazing. I was amazed by their service. The food was delivered before the expected time. I would surely order again. The price list is also reasonable.
309737,A great place for Chinese food maniacs. This place delivers some great flavours at your doorstep. Recently tried chilli garlic fried rice and golden fried prawns from here and found them to be extremely scrumptious. Packaging was also done nicely and delivery was on time. Would surely love ordering from here in future as well!!
309737,One of my fav places for chinese food. They have the best and authentic chinese food in Delhi.I really love the chilly chicken gravy and hakka noddles. Lip smacking taste . Value for money. Always deliver on time. Highly recommended.
1866,"Its a decent place to sit and have meal . A small outlet serving tempting food with lot of options !!!  We went to this resutrant for my dads birthday celebration and the place didnt let me down.  This is a spacious well laid out resturant with very couteous team to look after you.  Malai kofta and mushroom do pyaza was superb in taste.  Well priced , decent quantities and wonderful ambience to go with it .The sitting is comfortable can easyly accommodate more then 8 ppl on big table ."
1866,Best indian food üî•üî• amazing and mouth watering foodüòçüòç
1866,Pathetic Food.. Tasteless Soya Chaap.. Dal Makhni had burnt flavor.. Will never see this restaurant again.
9776,Mehak is an old outlet in kalkaji famous for its chole bhature ... we love the taste and repeatedly keep ordering
9776,"They sent ine tiny packet of chhole along with  3  plate of chhole bathure when called about quantity they seem unapologetic about the issue, i used to order every sunday from them and know the quantity was not what was sent"
3634,Best value for money. We order quite frequently. Better than C.R. Park market. Visit to outlet is worth while.
309238,Pretty nice place to get food from. I enjoyed their maggie and some of hotdogs.¬† Defineltely good for some street snacks like samosa chat and surely for mid night hunger.
309238,NiceüòÅ
309238,not value of oil
309238,"An amazing place to order from specially for your midnight hunger pangs!! I order from here everytime and it never disappoints me, totally recommend it :)"
309238,This small outlet serves fresh street food... We had the samosa chat... Which was as delicious as it looks in the picture..!!  The chutneys used were thick and super flavourful... It really took the dish to another level... Will be back for more..!
3054,A decent place for sweets and food.
3054,You can try but not that much good.
307951,Nice food and pocket friendly as well. Definitely a must go place as the ambience is good. Keep up the good work guys. Wish you all the best.
3610,Worst dish
3610,Worst ever outlet. They sent me stale ice cream which was supposedly just too old or probably expired. They should be taken off the app. If they cant even manage to keep up with the quality
3610,This place has messed up 2 of my orders - sent boxes with broken seal and v little quanttity of ice cream than ordered. This seems to be a standard problem with Giani's on at least the last few orders from other people as well - i wish i had read them before placing my orders. Zomato hasn't been handling my complain properly either- even though its seems to be standard issue.
3610,"Found pieces of glass in the sundae . Zomato being so much concerned about COVID-19 , and here the restaurant cant even see a piece of ‚Äúglass‚Äù . Any harm could have happened to my tongue . High level of careless ness . Zero recommendation for ordering from this branch."
3610,"Ordered 3 tubs of half litre - tuti fruti, kulfi and chocolate.. Opened the 3 tubs and found 2 were not 500ml... just half of the box.. only tuti fruiti was fine in quantity.. upon complaint with zomato they said Giani is saying that they are sending perfect.. it was a complete cheating.. moreover paid for waffle cone which was not sent at all... complete cheating...."
302892,"Very fast delivery.....¬† Taste was awesome....¬† And quantity of food was ... Good..¬†  I ordered Paneer lababdar, butter chicken and noodles. The quantity was great and the taste of noodles was yumm. I really liked their taste. the checf of Heaven;s kitchen really have magic in their hands, ¬† And price was very very pocket friendly.... so you can easily buy anything you want to eatüíó"
302892,"Food was not upto the mark ! Shahi paneer was too sweet to taste and raita too much salty moreover, rice was not well cooked."
309338,"I recently discovered this place that delivers brilliant north-Indian, restaurant-quality food.   The Methi Malai Chicken Tikka had a rich, creamy marination which gave it awesome flavours. The¬† Mutton Seekh Kebabs are super spicy.¬†  The packaging was adequate and sturdy. They sent cute forks with the appetizers."
309338,I ordered aloo parantha and paneer tikka.  The food was packed properly and was delivered hot.  The paneer tikka was soft and leaded with flavours which made it delicious. The pieces were huge and it was cooked well.  Aloo parantha was thin and stuffed well with masjed potatoes. It was soft and remained soft for a longer period.  Delivery was on time  Will definitely order from here again..
309338,"Delicious desi food delivered to your doorstep, what else could you ask for after a long day at work? This place dishes out some of the finest north-Indian delicacies.   I had the Methi Malai Chicken Tikka. Tender chunks of chicken were coated in a delightfully creamy marination and roasted to a juicy perfection! The generous amounts of methi used in the marination gave this dish incredible flavours.   Their Mutton Seekh Kebabs are hot. Delicate and heavily spiced, they will leave you wanting for more.   I also had thier Kali Mirch Chicken which had a gravy to die for. Heavily loaded with black pepper, the thick gravy was a pleasure to have. It left you feeling warm in your throat but spice lovers would find their bae in it!  The packaging was cute and sturdy. They even sent forks with the appetizers. +1 for the thoughtfulness!"
309338,"Ordered food from here and all my dinner plans were sorted.  I ordered makhni paneer, it was spicy but good to perfection and quantity was huge. Achari tandoori godi was another thing i loved. Never had such delicious chatpati gobhi ever before.. i had these with caramelized onion parantha. It was soft and fresh and the caramelized onions gave a good but different taste to the meal.  Packaging was good and the food reached me on time."
309338,"We recently ordered our dinner from here. And deciding to keep it simple, we stuck to the staple dishes. Our order for the dinner was, Chicken Kali Mirch Railway Chicken Lahsuni Naan The Chicken Kali mirch was actually the star of the evening. Mildly spiced, the white and a bit creamy gravy was just perfect. Paired with the naan, every bite was delicious.  Talking about the Railway Chicken, it didn't disappoint us either. Just that we can expected it to be a bit more spicy. Nonetheless, it was a decent experience.  Add to it, delivery on time.  Just that we wish the packaging is a bit more spill proof. A bit messy packaging makes it look a little less appetising.  If you like Indian fare, this place is a decent option to consider."
18372686,Superb food !!
18372686,In time of a pandemic they do not even care to give the food in a carry bag. They give it hand to hand which is extremely dangerous in such a time. Also the food was poorly cooked and chicken pieces were stale and very hard.
18372686,Had a lot of good food from here. Great stuff! Loved the cheese omelette sandwich ü•Ç
18372686,Currently this area comes near covid-19 hotspot area. You'll never know when the delivery guy entered in hotspot area for delivery. Try to avoid from this area.
18372686,"Ordered the mexican buritto bowl and it had NOTHING BUT A BOWL FULL OF RICE, with 3 tiny bites of tofy and 2 bites of brocoli with some tomato salsa on the side. Basically PAID Rs. 250 + for a Plastic bowl of rice. Horrible.  Starting on a good note, fresh menu has actually degenerated in many ways. Today's food delivery was just a reminder of the bad food and service"
7382,Good quality tasty food available at pocket friendly prices and also the hospitality is also satisfactory.
18245255,"I'm rating this place low on the basis of the wonderful quantity they serve. Have ordered thrice from here thinking that the first two times must have been a mistake, may be the employees are new or whatever. Ordered double meat all three times but the filling was not even apt for a normal single sub. Sorry, for me you guys are out"
18245255,"I saw Mr. Sub going up and down the kalkaji market Street. Since, then I wanted to try their subs and salad. An Indian version of Subway, Mr. Sub is an absolute replica of the Subway concept.   I ordered the following :- Spicy sambal chicken meatball sub - the meatballs are frozen. They are 1st microwaved and then put in the sub. I liked the Sambal spiciness, but I would recommend that you must only get 3 to 4 sauces as it becomes overwhelmingly runny and salty.  Italian herb chicken salad - I converted this to a salad with all the vegetables and Cubes of Italian chicken. The salad was excellent.   One can try Mr. Sub if they want to experience a change from Subway."
18245255,"Guys, I do not generally write a review. Am taking an effort here as I do not wish for anyone to ruine your day with a bad meal. I ordered for 2 subs, toasted, yesterday evening and i had to literally throw it away. The stuffing in sub was ok but the reason why it was inedible was because the bread was rock solid. YES, ROCK SOLID. I could not take a bite because it was so so hard. I have seen breads being hard in animated movies but this is first time i experienced it. Bread was also burnt from inside. I do not know how such establishments get the satisfaction of serving customers this kind of quality. Also the road runners who are assigned task of delivery are so rude. The restaurant captured my address wrong and the road runner starts blaming/ accussing me for  that error. So please do consider a 1000 times atleast before ordering from here."
18245255,"I ordered smoked chicken ham in a chipotle bread. Please work on the chicken ham part ( it wasn't that pleasing to me  ) , rest the sub was good though :)  Really liked it otherwise also it was packed so nicely in such a neat manner was really impressed by that :)"
18245255,Had a Mexican patty sub.... it was ok ok... like normal subways.... there is nothing new about Mr.Sub. They have to get something new.... and their stock is not up to date.... They were not having veg wraps.
8949,Talk about Chinese and trust me you would wanna eat from this place in Kalkaji ... The place is not a restaurant to dineout but does offer you to eat in the car - takeaway - Deliver .... I love the chicken sweet corn soup crispy honey chicken - Chicken Pan fried noodles .... If you're eating from here you must try these are üî•.... It ain't a fancy place but the food is amazing and the pretty reasonable too .... Recommended very strongly üëç
8949,"This Restaurant is very popular. I've heard so much about it. Finally got a order from here. It has a huge Chinese & Thai menu with a lots of options My order - stir fry Chinese green. Thai red curry chicken. Spicy grilled jumbo prawns. Chinese green had a lots of tasty and fresh vegetables. The Thai curry were really good, Prawns we're very good size. I really like the food. It was such a delight, Totally recommend."
8949,"Ranges between mediocre and inedible and food quality taste and standards fluctuate between the two randomly. Last order was the last time for sure: food was totally off, smelled very wonky and pretty sure it gave me a stomach infection the next day. A reliable friend recommended this place and got so-so food maybe 2 out of 5 times i ordered. Change management, kitchen, staff everything please. This is the nicest way i can describe it really."
302898,Very bad taste not able to eat
302898,Super pathetic food quality n quantity. Never expected these small portions in order. Shall never order again from here.
302898,We need our money back
302898,Weste of money üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
9654,V nice hotel. V old and reputable
9654,Hygienic place and also their samosa and bhalle papdi is good in taste..
9654,I had ordered soya chaap and it‚Äôs was good
9654,The prices are expensive but the quality is not so good it is Street rasgulla definition of this restaurant which we spent is not up to Mark ok I eat just one peace out of 4 and altitude was waste you should test yourself it was like chhapan aur something I can't able to explain taste it yourself it is not perfect
18322653,"I didn't like the taste, plus, the delivery was late."
18322653,best part is that I received the order before time
18322653,Folks never take food from this restaurant as there quality sucks yells n is stinking. If u still pick up food from here GOD saves u n ur family/colleagues from rotten stuff
18322653,Located in the double story area of kalkaji is a high speed delivery joint. Ratings of the outlet is too low but still i ordered food from them and it was yum. ü•ûShahi Paneer ü•ñ The best shahi paneer at the price they serve and was far better than the costly outlets too. Tawa Paranthas were homely but a little to take care of the tool on which they cook as it had left some black resins on the paranthas. Yummy Tummy
18322653,"Ordered paneer butter masala and lacha paratha from this joint which tasted pathetic. Paneer butter masala consisted of half cooked bland tomato gravy with chunks of paneer. Lacha partha was also not at all up to the mark, was delivered cold.On top of that, only half plate paneer butter masala was delivered {ordered full} that too 1hr late."
306957,"Very good food,hygienic and good blend of flavours.This place feed your fast food craving. Must try : chicken lollypop Cost for two : Rs.400"
306957,Ordered momos...requires immediate upgradation..tasteless chutney and even bad momos...momos felt like it was kind of more than 3 4 days old
306957,Although the delivery was quick... The food was not more than average... Ordered veg manchurian combo and chili chicken combo... It was accompanied by spring rolls and kimchi salad....  Kimchi salad... 1.5/5 Spring roll..... 2/5 Fried rice..... 3.5/5 Veg manchurian.... 2/5
306957,Great taste and pocket friendly meals. Tried Honey Chilly Potatoes for the first time and they were damn tasty!! Other items like Singapore Noodles and Veg. Manchurian was also upto the mark. Home delivery was also made on time.üëçüëç
306957,bad experience they are very late and food is worthless and the person who took the order didn't even took the initiative to pick up the call i request all to never order from here
813,Good place at Khan Market.. really nice food.. i likes the como which is served only during lunch hours. I was alone so that made my perfect meal. After reading poor reviews about service i was little skeptical but my experience was good.. seems somebody trying to defame the restaurant.
3425,Rs.500+ for literally 3 tiny cubes of cake is not worth it.
3425,"Interesting location, not much of a view, decent service, limited menu and expensive pricing but then what do you expect from a place above Good Earth!!"
304628,I ordered a two verity and both are tasty they both are reasonable prices and both tastes are unique and different from others stalls plz try mouth watering dishes and plz follow my page on instagram (spicynation2020) follow fore more food updates ‚ù§Ô∏è
304628,"Had gone there yesterday , very smelly and stale Bhalla Papdi chaat and very oily and tasteless aloo tikki , have been going there since ages but yesterday stuff was horrible and the person making Bhalla Papdi was rude and truly badtameez"
304628,This place is a hidden gem in the vicinity f india gate. Located in the Street of upsc. They serve variety of chaats. They're freshly made and hygienic. Delicious ‚ô• I just loved bhallaa papdi and aloo tikki papdi. There's no seating arrangement but you won't regret coming to this place because it won't take more than 2 min to finish your chaat. ;)
304628,"This is one place i have been coming over the years now. This is one old place where our parents find that same old school nostalgia of coming and eating here when they were young. I remember my dad telling me stories about how amazingly good the chat used to be here and how he used to save money to come here with his friends for chat party.  This is not just my story, half the people who come and eat here are present for the nostalgia of it. My dad tells that the taste has reduced a bit but that still d oesn't reduce the his love for this place. Everytime we are in Delhi or any guest is in Delhi, he suggests this place as the first in his list.  The prices are all somewhere betweeon 50-70 bucks and the quality and quantity are both impressive. The chat is made fresh right in front of you and it is delicious. Over the years, i have eaten almost everything more than 10 times. My favorite has to be the Aloo tikke and the aloo chat. The Bhalla papdi is what is the most famous dish of this place however, i am not a fan of it honestly. I also like Dahi panipuri but nothing beats the hot crispy tikke deep fried in desi ghee topped with chutneys and dahi. The dahi needs a special mention, for it is so thick, creamy and delectable. The cold dahi and the consistency that goes on the chat is clearly a match made in heaven.  Do try if you haven't already!"
18221038,"Simple yet trendy, this place stands out amidst the fancy and loud joints in and around Khan Market.. early evening supper visits were made memorable with the sumptuous chicken and peanut toasters as well as refreshing mocktails.. Minimalistic interior decor and trendy similarities with mathematics leaves you hooked to the style.. low music helps to have more effective and fun conversations as you catch up and unwind with your group.. good to visit for a quiet experience :)"
18221038,"Visited this place recently and ordered a few appetizers and drinks. Since we were in a relatively large group, the place was a good choice. Fairly spacious, food tasted good and nice options of cocktails and beers. This place also serves various types of Simba beer (with offers) which is not very common in Delhi restaurants yet. It is a nice place to hangout in Khan Market. The staff was polite and courteous."
18221038,"It's a good place - nice interiors. Food is good too though the options are limited. I have rated it a 3 mainly because of the service and staff - our server was courteous but not knowledgeable about the menu. Also, all the desserts except one were unavailable. Hence a 3 only! All in all not a bad place though - might visit again ..."
18221038,"One of many such places in Khan Market, this is a pretty good place to try once with a trendy decor and reasonably good service.  We ordered fresh lime soda for drinks, paprika fries for starters, which were very different, stuffed chillies, which were pretty interesting and fettuccine¬†apple pasta, which was really unique and delicious.  The prices were also ok.  All in all,¬† a good experience overall."
18221038,"A place definitely ahead of its time here in Delhi. All of the cocktails I have had here so far have been amazing (and trust me I have had way too many). Anyone heading there definitely should try out the chicken parm and aglio-e-olio. Surely, the best everyday bar in town, love their minimalist and modern interiors."
154,They have a variety of subs to choose from. Their paneer tikka and chicken tikka sub is my favourite
154,I went to this restaurant with one of my friend then we order a sub of the day sandwich fir us i ordered a nonveg and my friend ordered a veg sandwich. The taste was good and it was healthy also.
154,if you are super hungery like me ... so i tried subway's rosted chicken and chicken tandoori üåÆüçóüçñ and it was amazing. Simply Loved it yummy!!
154,Subway could easily pass off as the national health food chain. I like their veggie delite and aloo patty sub. They both taste good and are quite filling.
154,Double chunk cookies are the best
309576,Great place for take-away.. Serves authentic Mughlai cuisine.. Mutton Galouti is to die for.. Their seekh kebab is also really good  Cons: Bit pricey
309576,"best mouth watering kebabs, especially recommended to be visited on a cold winter evening. The Kakori Kebabs are literally the best. Even the Fish Tikka tasted amazing. Also this place makes mutton better than chicken, just my judgement. Must try though^_^"
309576,"If you're in Khan and you're wanting to have some mughlai without having to wait a long time for it.¬†  Azam's mughlai is the spot for you.  It's a small shop though with no seating arrangement, but serves some great mutton seekh rolls.¬†  Pricy but great kebabs.¬†¬†  Do check them out if you're in the vicinity.¬†"
309576,Love their rolls and Roasted chicken. I wish they had some seating arrangements but then that's the experience of this place.
301422,Somewhat underwhelmed. Though they claim to have relaunched the restaurant with the old classic menu - the food is flat and falls short of either the Indian Hakka Chinese or traditional Cantonese. Read my detailed review at https://www.instagram.com/p/B8RZvVQlvyq/?igshid=140gr4xw3bqcy
301422,Beutiful ambience good services Excellent food quality Must try tiger prwan sesame Best fine dining restaurant Its a good restaurant if you love chinese food.
301422,"A place where you will love everything.,,,  Awesomely tastiest food .. We ordered mixed meat garlic noodles, schewan chicken, Chicken pentagon, Bulls eye ..  everything was superbly delicious üòã   Service of this place is five out of five ..  To be specific I highly appreciate the extraordinary efforts which Lokesh did for us .. I pre book my table but I was late and he extended his service to us .. we had a great time.   Loved my overall experience :)"
301422,Excellent food and a very nice ambience. The staff is extremely courteous too. The freebies before the meal make one feel very welcome. A definite yes for a repeat visit.
303574,"There are many items you can order from here. We had dal fry butter, loads of butter they had put, it was tasty, butter chicken is their speciality, non-veg thali was also decent in size. 2 people could eat."
303574,"It is a little place in khan market. We saw a lot of bad reviews on Zomato but still decided to try it. The first few times they served really good food but last time, the mixed veg was stale in thali. Maybe it was a one time thing but don‚Äôt want to try it again."
303574,"Best place to eat in khan market. Staff is really courteous and i have tried home delivery that is also quick . I loved shahi paneer, butter chicken is the must try."
303574,However that eating joint at this place is not so bad but the main reason of giving only three stars is due to their location their improper sitting arrangement and behaviour of staff
303574,"I read a few comments on zomato , which were not so good.I wanted to explore this place but every time I would go there(in the afternoon) I found it closed.But one day, luckily I found this place open. I ordered a deluxe thali, ""the food was really good""Except for the sweet dish. Because the quality of ""Gulab jamun"" they gave with thali was different from the one I ordered separately. Overall experience was really good.Explore this place to satiate your hunger when around khan market."

4624,Had always a high opinion about them but was highly disappointed with my recent experience of Cake with toppings of seasonal fruits. It looked very tempting but once brought home and had it was soggy and tasteless was expensive and certainly not worth the price. Chocochip muffins were nice though.
6271,"Visited this hidden gem at Khan Market last weekend.  The place serves lip-smacking non-veg optionsü§§  I would highly recommend the following items:  1. Chicken malai tikka 2. Kakori kebab 3. Mutton seekh kebab 4. Chicken tikka 5. Afghani tikka cream  There is hardly any place to sit, most people opt to sit in their cars and enjoy the scrumptious meat options.  Prices are pocket friendlyüòÉ  If you are looking to enjoy high quality non-veg indian kebabs near the Khan Market area, then I would highly suggest you to check this place outüòÅ"
6271,Been there last Sunday. Hidden gem in Khan market. Good place for some quick bites. Shop is small but food is great. Awesome Afghani chicken with super awesome gravy. #afghanichicken #lazizkabab
6271,Better than another highly rated kebab takeaway place in Safdarjung. The Achari Chicken Tikka and Malai Soya chap are the best ones. The quality of materials used and the peaceful old school way of preparing the food along with amazing service makes it a 5 star place!
18361747,"Can't believe this place has been open for a year and I haven't heard of it. Came across it while searching for WiFi cafes in Khan Market. With its first outlet in India, this Sri Lankan import is here for good.  Food: -Welcome Drink: A refreshing and tangy cold tea served in a shot glass. Absolutely loved it! -Prince of Kandy Iced Tea: Pretty great in taste but I'm sure it's not the best they have to offer. Loved the presentation! -Sundried Tomato and Pesto Sandwich: Good but not great.   Ambience: Comfortable and tasteful. No complaints.   Service: Friendly and professional albeit a tad slow.   Great place to chill and/or work. Can't wait to try more of their cool Iced Teas and their Tea Shakes."
18361747,"Located in Khan Market this place is a gem if u consider the ambience specially if u r a tea lover. T louge exists in Sri Lanka and Dubai as well not sure of other countries and each palce aesthetically done. As the name suggests u have unlimited options for tea more than u can imagine, in fact they have tea shakes. Food menu is ok having more options on the sweeter side like waffles, creps and cakes. Its a nice cozy place for office meetings and gupshup over chai. For their sheer beauty and innovative tea they deserve an extra marks. But i would prefer if they enhance their food menu fo those who do not have sweet cravings."
18361747,"Been here multiple times - you'll get interesting beverages here that you won't see in too many other places. The interiors are really comfy too. Sometimes, though, you might be let down by unavailability and less than reasonable prices of some of the items."
18361747,One of hidden spots in Khan market. It is pretty quiet enough to be able to focus on reading. I love hitting this spot for chilling with the tea from Sri Lanka.
18361747,"The place was lit  Beautiful interiors, quite ambiance, slow instrumental soothing music and a friendly service is what i experienced here.  The place is full of bright colours and is so clean and hygienic.  The staff welcomed us by serving the welcome drink which was the organic ice tea and it had a sweater and sour taste. The welcome drink left a beautiful impression on us and we were quite excited of how would the food taste here. We ordered a smoked chicken grill sandwich and blueberry fruit waffle.  The smoked chicken was cooked properly with a little mint mayo and very less salt. The sandwich was very much impressive. Then came the blueberry waffle which was also very tasty. The waffle was very much cooked and had a sweet taste and the blueberry topping just added a good flavour to it.   All in all this place is a must visit for a alone time and a peaceful afternoon."
18400736,"Ordered fettuccine lemone, got a lemon ice tea instead, hard to understand how you can mix up a pasta dish with a drink. Still waiting for a refund. None of the telephone numbers work for this place either so no way to get a replacement."
18400736,"Order coal miner pizza and smoke and mirrors pizza from owl is well few days back when i was craving for pizza. Loved their packing, such creative and beautiful types of boxes that u would want to keep. Both was pizza was super tasty and its hard for to decided which is best."
18400736,"Order French kiss pizza, garlic bread and hazelnut brownie. The pizza has just the right amount of toppings and the jalapeno flavor on the garlic bread was great. So happy with the service and the food, that I would try other things and recommend others too!!!"
18400736,It was my first order from owl is well. Order pizza and pasta both from here. I liked their pasta more than their pizza. Their gravy of pasta is one of the best i have tried till now. My recommendation to try their spicy mac and cheese pasta.
4450,"I Heard Lots About This Place And Find It Equally Good ,There Shanghai chicken is my all time favourite will love to again for that ."
4450,A good and a casual place to order food ... Right from their fast food to their Chinese cuisines ... It's all good to binge on ... A must for Non veg lovers ....
4450,Veryyy Delicious  Must Try!
4251,This place has been one stop shop for me since 2012. It‚Äôs like my other home now I feel. Starting from their Cafe 6 Cold Coffee to everything what Amit customisations is fingerlicious... The owner is a kickass person and is amazing person to talk with!! Great Food & Coffee!
4251,Amazing food with friendly atmosphere. Owner takes care of every order that's why each order is turned up special
4251,Amazing cafe in midst of a nice locality. Must try is their cold coffee and Bombay sandwich
3400,"My craving for wanting to taste Jjajangmyeon made me find this place. Probably the only restaurant in Delhi NCR to be serving the authentic ‚Äòjjajang‚Äô. The portions are too big and hence the pricing is so high. The quantity definitely doesn‚Äôt disappoint. Gung‚Äôs sitting arrangement definitely ensures privacy with traditional decor and artifacts. I ordered - Jjajangmyeon and a ramen stew.  I was expecting the Jjajangmyeon to be spicy and oily but the flavour profile was very mild, earthy and oily with flavor of pork singing through. A pretty heavy dish packed with lots of onions, zucchini, oil and pork. A nice dish according to me. The ramen stew was a huge pan enough for about 4 people (I wish I hadn‚Äôt been that greedy!!) I was told this will be spicy but it was definitely on the sweeter side with a extremely deceiving ‚Äòred‚Äô color! Slightly disappointed by this one.  Tried the plum wine along with our food! Really interestingly served in a jug with tiny shot glasses; more on the sweeter side, it complimented the Jjajang.  Overall a nice authentic korean experience! Cheers!!  Follow my food journey on Instagram at AllThatSheAte!!"
3400,"I visited this place yesterday, food was really tasty . I was satisfied like the food was healthy and way of delivering was fantastic, you can also order at your on place , and price is also good. This place if highly recommended. Will make sure to visit again"
954,"Tasty, hygienic food...I always overeat here..."
954,We regularly order food from this place. It is located in Yusuf Sarai market near Green Park. They serve really nice South Indian food. Their rawa masala dosa with sambhar is a must try.
954,"Inspite of specifically mentioning for providing spoons and tissues, the same were not provided..Secondly when earlier we ordered this dish, it used to come with Coconut and Red Chutney..Why the same was not provided this time. Dun expect incomplete orders from an old restaurant like Karnataka.. Pathetic"
954,Paneer butter masala was not at all good felt like it was made of coconut cutney as it also had kade patta and did not like the taste at all really unhappy with it.
307391,"Ordered thier signature boozy chocolate whiskey caramel cake and also berries n cream for our anniversary. The cake was had after about 12 hours from pick up but tasted amazingly well. The soft and moist berries n cream literally melts in your mouth. As someone who doesn't like much sugar in any form, the cakes by Sugarama was an exception. The sugar content was minimum yet the taste and texture of the cakes were beautiful. Also, not to forget their attention to details and customer service deserve a huge shoutout. Thanks guys and hope you guys continue to bake amazing goodies. Cheers."
307391,"I ordered two salted caramel tarts, and spent ‚Çπ200 extra on 2 happy anniversary poppers add ons, expecting that a 4+ rated bakery joint would follow my directions. Not only they did not add the items that I paid for, but also refused to take responsibility of it. I haven‚Äôt heard from them till date regarding this mess up."
303716,"I ordered the black forest nougat. Tasted below average, possibly old. One can give some benefit of doubt due to lockdown etc but still, not worth it at all."
5565,It was a nice experience here. I‚Äôve been here too many times and it‚Äôs good to have sandwich with lemonade. They also serve good gol gappe. Veg biryani with raita is a good combination. Located nearby to diggin gives you a good crowd and environment. Overall it‚Äôs a good package.
5565,"Mithapur earlier known as Mithas is famous for its gol gappe because they use mineral water to prepare it. The red coloured water served with gol gappas is out of the world and is a must try for every gol gappe lover. We ordered veg sandwich, nimbu pani, aloo tikki, gol gappe and veg uttapam. Veg sandwich was awesome and delicious. Totally worth giving a try. Aloo tikki served with chhole was yummy. Nimbu pani was also nice and uttapam was also tasty. Only the sambhar and chutney served with uttapam were not upto the mark. Service was okay.  Food: 4/5 Ambience: 4/5 Staff: 4/5 Service: 3.5/5 Value for money: 4.5/5"

5565,"It is an average restaurant with average service, ambience and food.  On my visit I ordered vegetable chowmein and pizza which were good but the presentation was basic also it took a little too long to come as there was a rush at the restaurant. I Don't have any pictures from my visit! üôà This place can be used as your last comfortable option as here you'll find your traditional and continental food done in traditional old school basic style. Being near to two big colleges of the Delhi university it attracts a lot of customers and thus has a value for money and was pocket friendly."
5565,The ambience is okaish Food is okayish Fyn place to sit and eat street food!with friends! Service is fine Overall not too good not too bad I

18446391,"Had these great chilli chicken rolls at this amazing place, man they were unlike any chicken rolls i have had, the wraps were pre-cooked with egg, and then lined with the mouthwatering amalgamation of Green Chilli, Chipotle, tomato ketchup mixed with puree and to top it all off was mayonnaise. if this doesnt excite your salivary glands, those bountiful chunks of chicken tikka, barb-e-cue'd just right to give off that smoky charred taste of chicken yet subtle enough for your tongue to enjoy the sauces will definitely get your motor running."

18371289,Love the rolls. Even the guy in charge is very polite. Only problem is seating not available. Also should be open for online orders. I dont even mind paying a bit of extra buck for the kind of food these guys make.
18371289,"Read many comments about this small kathi roll joint, so thought of giving it a try. I was in a mood for some lip-smacking rolls so I ordered 1 single egg roll and double paneer roll. Paneer role was so huge I started thinking that how can I eat both the rolls all by myself? I first tried the single egg role. It was so heavenly. The sauces they add are just amazing. Then let's come to the gigantic double paneer roll. When I took the first bite I knew that I'll eat all this by myself, IT WAS SO FREAKING GOOD. I've also had their chicken roll which is also really good. Overall its the best place if you want some good rolls in reasonable prices."
18371289,"Hands down brilliant rolls. Ordered in the mutton seekh and chicken tikka rolls to the office, everyone is all praises. The food is great, the meat was tender and the base was crisp. That too for such ease on your pocket.! 10/10 will buy again."
18371289,Must go.. Nice place with some of the best rolls. Great and lovely place for kathi roll lovers. There chiken tikka roll is the beat from all

18396161,"Promised to deliver in 40 mins, took nearly 80 mins. Even then the order wasn't complete came without breads, so they basically expect you to have the gravy items without any breads. The garlic naans that came  to us were without any butter. The food doesn't taste good. Pretty ordinary. Rather less than ordinary.  So, DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SHIT RESTAURANT."
18396161,Worst place to order food !  If you wish to have dinner make sure you order it by lunch time they will take minimum 6 hours to reach your place !  Quality and service is as bad as there delivery !
18396161,"Ordered the combo plates, Chinese and Indian. The Chinese plate had smelly rice. My mother had to throw it in the dustbin. I called them and complained. Their delivery boy came after an hour after repeated calls. He took away only 1 Chinese Combo's rice and refused to even acknowledge that we had to throw the other Combo even though we showed him the thrown rice and the spoiled sweet dish which was a part of the combo. Waited another hour and he brought back half quantity of rice than was there in the Thaali. For North Indian Thaali, they had written Mixed Veg and Paneer with Rice and Roti. They didn't send Mix Veg and when questioned, they said they didn't have any mix veg, which they didn't inform when we ordered the food. Truly awful experience. The manager said these things happen and was rude. First and last experience. No wonder restaurants like these go out of business soon. No inkling of what customer satisfaction rate is. Proceed to order at your own risk. We had to throw Rs. 450 worth food in the dustbin."
18396161,Ordered through Swiggy in less than 1km radius and the food was delivered cold.  Breads were soo hard and shahi paneer was tomato sauce. Not at all recommended
18396161,Worst food The food was smelly and taste less. Don't go for it you will waste your money. Shahi paneer was full of sugar and dall makni was tasteless.
312798,"I Never Wanted To But Finally They Forced Me To Post A Negative Comment For A Resto. The Food, the taste, the management everything is literally unbearable if you prefer good quality or atleast decent quality food. And over that the entire menu is overpriced.  Would prefer a street kiosk instead."
312798,I have given 3 chances to this restaurant but all 3 times horrible food . Be it chicken curry or mutton fry or veg food . The food will make you sick . Please either change your cook or close the place .
312798,"I had ordered chicken biryani, I am from south, the biryani is cheaper compared to Hyderabad...taste is simply awesome....especially Mirchi Ka salan it was tastiest...then I went along with my friends for my salary appraisal...it was the most delightful experience, the party was organised for 50 people....I really loved the food Dal makhani or Kadai paneer was simply delightful...We had greatest time at this restaurant...wish everyone visit this restaurant and taste the biryani"
312798,I recently organize a bday party at this place for 30 pacs. Very pathetic experience. Service was very bad. Food preparation was poor. Commitment not fulfilled. Not even a single@ thing is upto mark. Overall not at all recommended for at least north indian gathering or food.
18455557,"Ordered for the first time and new to Delhi saw this restaurant online so prefer to orderd dosa and Non veg thali and it's good , recommend to other people also because everything is at 99 üòÄ"
18455557,"Ordered from here. The worst South Indian I've ever seen. Stale Dosa, rock-hard Idli and Vada. The flavours were not so great either. Absolutely ruined my lunch for a day."
18455557,The food was deliver after 1.5 hours! Food was stale and smelling very bad. The delivery boy had no balance to call me for checking my address. I had to call the restaurant to ask his number. Please don't order from this place.
18455557,"Want to order some food so I visit on zamato ,then my search starts Then I saw some gud option according to my budget there I saw one brand which says all day 99 on zamato and saw there menu which is gud and price says 99 .... every thing,then I was tried to ordering from zamato but option says closed for ordering then I called up restaurant to order ... I order thali , South Indian combo, and Chinese dishes which reach in 1 hr that's not an issue I can understand there brand is like this and except to get order between 50-60 min which was informed by restaurant,food was really nice ü§òü§ònow this joint is my favourite now acc to my budget and option of food is also good recommend fto orders !!Best wishes to the team."
18455557,"This restraunt is too bad, they don't deliver what they say, I hate it, they are too slow and they don't even pick up the calls after taking money"
310344,Chilly chaap is awesome famouse in lajpat nagar. Fries is also very good with chilly chutney.Wow. Chowmein. Manchurian almost all Chinese items available
310344,"This restaurant has been closed long time back...why are you making people fool Zomato people...remove this from your list.....,...................."
310344,Had a best chaap here and this is coming from a group of people who are big time chaap lovers. Malai chaap masala chaap momos everything is just amazing! I would order from here almost every week but sadly it's out of coverage area of zomato's delivery service
310344,"Food is great,affordable,tasty but the only thing which pinches is that it is unhygienic.if I go for FOOD:8/10 HYGIENE:2/10 STAFF:6/10 OVERALL:7/10"
310344,"The pricing is more than pocket friendly, it is dearth cheap! And for a reason, the food is just bad. Have ordered Chicken noodles and fried rice twice from here and both times, there was not a shred of chicken in the food. You don't want to order from here."
18260714,"Die for pyaz ki kachori they serve. This kachori is one of my favourite and couldn't stop myself when this comes in front. Earlier it was for 35 and now for 40, but one should definitely try this amazing kachori here."
18260714,I have ordered samose and Pyaaz kachori from this place today.The samose were good but trsut me pyaaz kachori was awesome.I have tried pyaaz ki kachori of Rajasthan as well and belive me this outlet gives a close competition to that kachori.And the best part is its so economical and pocket friendly plus very good in quantity.
18265724,Ordered it via zomato really liked the food packaging was ok ok so overall 4/5.
18265724,"I m very unhappy with the standard of food and packing. I ordered online rajma-chawal and gobi parantha but the rajma is tasteless, half cooked and full of oil and the quality of rice was not good and the parantha was half-cooked, all its corner were thick and uncooked... totally unsatisfied"
18265724,"One of the pocket friendly places in lajpat Nagar. Good food to order for lunch and dinner. Their thali is good. The traditional Dal makhni, shahi paneer and nan is the best. Food 8/10 Service if you visit there 6/10 Ambience 6/10"
18265724,"Amazing food each item on the platter was a delight. Paneers were tender and smooth, perfect blend of the masalas properly added. Being a non vegeterian this platter was a shift in taste for me."
308704,"Chocolates, Cakes, Flavoured Dry Fruits, Dehydrated Fruits, Gift Packing, Wedding Cards, Trousseau Packing, Diwali Gifting, Birthday & Baby Announcement Gift Packing"
308704,I ordered a half kg cake. Bread was hard and the design which I gave didn't match not even the color. How difficult is it to make a rose petal shaped Cake.In all a very bad experience.
308704,They have absolutely beautifully decorated chocolates..  I went thr last valentine when my boyfriend bought the chocolate rose for me. I love the taste but I found thz place lill expensive..
308704,Got it as a return gift from someone. Chocolates were good but packing is not at all good. They pasted the chocolates with the glue which spoiled the tray. I called up my friend who got it done though Choco craft. He said that they are not even apologizing for this mistake. ¬†Please work professionaly and make good name in the market. Compensate for the loss.
310358,"Great variety of cold cuts and marinated meats. My favorites are their Mutton and chicken seekh kebab, chicken salami, chicken thighs and drums of heaven."
310358,Visited this place today....I am very hungry...I went there with my friends.....we ordered....chicken bucket..... We loved the environment.. We loved the ambience... We loved the food.. The crowd was quite cool...
310358,"They are the rudest place ever. Especially in the evenings - they will bang the phone, not take orders and just not listen. I think they need a change in management."
310358,We order from them at least once a week! Amazing products from cooked to uncooked. Best is dal makhni and shaahi paneer along with butter chicken.
18425161,"Please try a very tasty biryani for a damn cheap price : 40 rs for a plate . It is served hot with adons like  chutney , gravy and salad. They also sell raw chicken ."
18391309,This is small cafe with decent interiors and ambience.¬† Place is small but menu has good variety where you can choese your favourite dish.¬† Had chicken burger which was value for money.
18391309,"Been there last week after a friend recommended... ambience was small but calm and clean. Staff was helping and friendly. We ordered Free range chicken burger, vegan delight pizza, ricotta hotcakes in food. For beverages we had my fav banofee shake and french fresh pressed coffee. Everything was fresh and healthy. Totally organic and nicely cooked. Must visit place :) Well done"
18391309,"Altitude cafe is the must place to visit in Lodhi colony meher Chand market. Space and ambience is small though because of terrace area sealing by govt. Still it calm and perfect place to have coffee and some munchies. We ordered Free range chicken burger, vegan delight pizza, ricotta hotcakes for food . In Beverages we took banofee shake and blue tokai blend French press coffee. Specially I loved the coffee ... smooth and strong same time. Everything is freshly made and so delicious. Staff for helping and humble. Loved it. Good work guys üëç"
18391309,"Great Staff,average food and good ambiance and vibes sums up this place for us.wend their on Saturday morning tried Kambucha which was good,Margarita pizza indian version which was average and pasta which was decent.overall a fine place to go to."
18391309,"Big portion of food and decent, not like other cafe. This place can fulfill your stomach for a whole day long. And friendly staff from beginning til end. :)  But will never come back as it is not organic"
5727,The roasted chicken is really good here. Looking at the value for money and the taste it isn't that bad and you can grab a nice snack once in a while from this outlet.
5727,Why would you visit this place when you have greenchick just adjacent where everything is so much better. They took about half an hour to just heat the punjabi chicken tikka and it was not the least delicious. It was so small and there were only 2 people for service who had no decency. I had to keep on asking for the bill. It seemed like a small roadside restaurant with prices as high as anything
5727,"Roc's  quality of sausages has degraded. Before they were dense, juicy and flavourful but now they just melt in the pan on boiling and instead of having whole sausages one has to have scrambled ones. And they have hiked their rates through the roof ... b4 they used to sell 250 gms for rs 70 and nw they sell it for 120 ..."
5727,really poor service by roc nd this was the last time i used roc.i waited for 2 hours nd then they told me that they do not have a delivery boy.nd they also told me that if they can send the order in morning.i am really stunned to see this type of service.
5727,"The only reason I am giving poor rating is because of the Store Manager of this branch, who is very arrogant and perhaps does not understand what it is like to be in the Service Industry. Talking about ROC's chicken, my Freezer is always stuffed with their products, especially Frankfurters, Mustard Chilli Wings, Raw Chicken Breast and Raw Chicken (cut-pieces). And the signature Herb Roast is great too. But when you receive such a bad attitude and statements from a senior member of staff, you wouldn't want to even think about going there again and especially when you have been loyal towards the brand for the last two years, spent like zillions."
311766,The best part about this place is servicing. The staff is really good and very courteous. Food was well prepared and it's value for money. Decent ambience.   One of those places where you can have a quite lunch or dinner with your loved ones.
311766,"Old fashioned Chinese restaurant. Reminds you of Golden Dragon. The place was empty when we went, the interiors are ordinary. The funny part is that from outside you cannot even make out whether this is a restaurant. Decided to have some food packed.  The Prawn Harkao and vegetable Suimai were well prepared. Sliced Chicken in hot bean sauce along with mixed fried rice were both good. I think the owners have another restaurant called Icon in alaknanda because the packaging had the name and address on it. Good Chinese food at a low cost."
311766,Walked into to the place by chance...Decor is average..the food was okay..but my rating is merely on the fact of the service offered...Kudos to the Servers who pampered us...
311766,This neighborhood needed a traditional style Chinese / Thai restaurant. The chicken dishes are just fabulous. The service and the staff are very good too.
311766,"Visited this place out of sheer curiosity. This is a relatively new joint in the main Lodhi Colony Market overlooking Veer Savarkar Park that divides the market into two. The restaurant is right next to Guppy by Ai.  First impression: Since the place is relatively new, there weren't many patrons, even on a Sunday afternoon.  The Food: As soon as we were seated, the staff brought along 2 bowls of kimchi. We ordered a Beijing Chicken for starters and it was really really good. Crisp on the outside and soft inside. It had the right amount of heat in it rendered through, I guess, fried red chillies, and served with ample quantity of fried cashew and peanuts. Paired with the chutney, I was simply mouth-watering!  For the mains we ordered a Diced Chicken Hong Kong along with Chilli Garlic Noodles. The noodles were good, though they could have been a bit more spicier. Were on the 'milder' side for a Chilli Garlic Noodle.  The chicken though good, had a peculiar fishy/chickeny taste that I failed to understand.  The staff: The staff were courteous and attentive.  Overall, a nice experience."
6222,A good place for breakfast and fast food. You can enjoy sweets also. I like samasya and paratha there. The size of paratha a little big. Two persons can enjoy the one. It us near road side so one can easily park their vehicle near shop. You can also order them fir parties. I love this place for fast food.
6222,"This place is in Khanna market near lodhi colony. This restaurant serve variety of sweets and snacks I tried many different things here like noodles , dhokla samosa. The prices are average as well the quality of food."
6222,"Insta page-@pestolicious Not sure about other things served here but it serves the best chowmein in lodhi colony! It is a must try, take my word for it!"
6222,One of the best veg restaurant in Lodhi colony because this restaurant offer good quality food in very reasonable price . I ordered dhokla and rasmalai which is very good ......and even you can go for jalaebi ....samosa or chowmein which is also good .so it is very good restaurant when you have very tight budget and good place for hangout with friends......... looking forward to visit again .
6222,Shop is good...... It is like a normal sweet shop but there sweet is good in taste or also they make fresh sweet. So like it.................................Thank you
309882,"Nice place to have Rajasthani Thali.   Kachoris were very good as they are freshly cooked. Must try bajra khichadi with ghee and bura, its yummy.    Few dishes need more Rajasthani flavour."
309882,When will this restaurant open?? Eagerly waiting to try food here.. never been here before.. food looks better than rajdhani... They have not provided any contacts too
309882,"The best restaurant I've been to in Delhi in terms of food, hospitality, ambience, value for money, the works!!! Can't wait for it to re open soon!!!"
309882,"Being a Rajasthani, I was craving some ‚Äòhomeland‚Äô food. While the experience at the outlet has been decent, the food that came with the order wasn‚Äôt much to write back home about. Now I don‚Äôt know whether it was the packaging or the fact that it was delivered so late that it was cold. But, I‚Äôm definitely going back to Defence Colony to get some daal baati!"
309882,"Visited this place with my friends. Very gd ambience as per the location. But seats r limited, so better u avoid peak hours. Food was awesome and gives the feeling of Rajasthan.  The only thing which disappointed me, is their service. Very very late. Even u can shout on them, but somehow I control.  Taste -3.5/5 Ambience - 4/5 Service - 2/5 Variety - 4/5"
4268,"They are taking complete undue advantage of the lockdown. I visited them personally wrote down my order clearly and as requested paid the full amount of Rs 5500 to pick up the next morning as it was a big order. Sent my driver to pick up the order the next day and the items were wrong! Besties The process took an hour as neither would they deliver (in def col) nor would they let my driver enter, nor would they hand over the order at the door! The staff and guard were super rude! Corona doesn‚Äôt give a reason to give third grade service!! Very disappointed and unexpected."
4268,"One of the iconic bakeries of South Delhi.  Anything you try from here will be great in terms of quality. The price they charge is also not too high considering its location.  Not just the sweet items, but savoury items such as patties should also be given a try.  In sweets, black forest cake, chocolate truffle cake and red velvet cake are a must try.  The ambience of the bakery has a vintage appeal to it.  Though there are many bakeries to try from in Defence colony main market, Defence Bakery should not be missed."
4268,Defence bakery is the Worst bakery I have ever seen in my life their quality is so bad . Even they have not worried about there customer at all . I personally visit their bakery to complain about my daughter first birthday cake but they have not value my words and feeling . But just said their make the cake like this only . Guys the cake a too much sweet and not even free .
4268,"If someone has been waiting for 5-6 minutes, you‚Äôre supposed to bill their order first regardless of how much of a hurry the other person is in. Basic principle of management which you can‚Äôt follow."
4268,One of the most iconic bakeries of Defence Colony. Great variety of desserts and some great savoury puffs.  Must try their vanilla tea cake!
60,A renowned South Delhi restaurant which opened up ages ago .... One of my personal favorites when it comes to eating mutton cuisines...The mutton seekh Roomali roll is amazing .... The quality - taste of the food is good and hasn't changed in years ... An average place to eat at as there nothing about the interiors or the ambience of the place ... Ordering in or perhaps eating in your car outside would be a better option on regular basis .... The prices I must say have gone up considerably over the years and it's fair to say that it's an expensive place to eat ....
60,"Colonel‚Äôs Kababz in Defence Colony, New delhi has been doing kebabs and curries since about 25 years now and their quality of food is definitely premium. In the picture: Gosht Seekh Kebab (Colonel‚Äôs Special)  The kebabs were succulent with amazing mutton blend which is very juicy and moist and the chuntey served along went very well with these but I found the kebabs to be a little overpriced, maybe because of the brand name associated to it, the quantity and presentation could be better.  @colonels.kababz  @colonels_kababz"
60,Food was good but too much salt in the preli dal tarka... so pls just put less salt...because we can alwz add more but cant redduce the salt pls
60,Very juicy mutton seekh kabab @colonel kabab defence colonel  delhi
1507,"Excellent customer support, provided by Mr.Dev!!! We had ordered some high-tea food boxes. Food was nearly packaged and tasted delicious. Pricing is comparable to other good bakeries...everyone loved the brownies!!! The cake was nicely executed!! Good job guys!"
1507,Excellent and very helpful staff. Rekha needs a special mention. Thanks
1507,I ordered a pineapple cake and the cake was fine but the pineapple inside and on the top was spoilt and acidic. Maybe expired stuff or incorrectly stored pineapple was used from the can without checking. I hope the someone in authority sees the review and gets it checked.
1507,I ordered an eggless chocolate truffle cake on 15th Nov 2019. The cake was cut and distributed to people I had over for dinner. People complained that it was tasting weird so I tasted a bit and it was indeed tasting really bad. I smelt it and was also smelling really awful. I am quite sure it was spoilt as it really smelled rotten. We had to throw the cake away because it was such as embarrassing situation for me. I am utterly disappointed with Angels in my kitchen. I want my money back.
1395,Ordered a chicken sandwich and chocolate fudge. The sandwiches are quite good although the the fudge could be crunchier. Packing‚Äôs decent...
1395,Brown Sugar is a superb place to eat. The taste and quality are unmatchable.  Wheat momos are must try and I have them regularly .  They have other outlets as well and the quality & taste is maintained.
1395,The food and hookah is good and also same as all but main issue is space is very low no dance floor.but ok for normal hangouts. Also good for bday partiess
1395,Cool place to hangout . Bliss for a momo lover. Variety of momos are quite good sort from that  staff is courteous and well behaved overall good to go place
1395,Best momos. Nice Ice tea. Veg momos are the best can't tell about the chicken ones but my colleagues love them. Some of them share years of bond with brown sugar... So keep it up.
305646,"One of the best bakery ever. They have excellent variety of cakes . Every cake here is just wow and taste extremely delicious. Apple crumble, strawberry seduction, chocolate truffles and fresh fruit are some of the best serves I recommend ."
305646,"This happened right now. It is my parent‚Äôs anniversary and I recommended whipped for dessert. I didn‚Äôt realise that I had made a huge mistake until now.   We ordered 3 desserts- a kahlua cupcake and a nutty chocolate slice for my parents and a tiramisu slice for me. The nutty chocolate slice was the worst out of the lot as it didn‚Äôt seem fresh at all and didn‚Äôt taste good. The cookie base at the bottom couldn‚Äôt be broken and the sponge was also very hard. My parents complained about this, however the employee insisted that this is how it‚Äôs made. The tiramisu was better but a little warm, considering that it was kept in the fridge. The cupcake was also descent, but not exceptional.   There were leftovers of the nutty chocolate slice and tiramisu so we got them packed. Immediately after coming home, I opened the box to finish my tiramisu. This is when I lost my cool, as I saw ants crawling out of the dessert. I‚Äôm extremely disappointed and disgusted with the quality of your desserts. We were expecting some delicious, good quality desserts considering the high prices. Of all the bakeries in Delhi, I was not expecting this from whipped and our assumption about the dessert being old and stale, unfortunately, turned out to be true.  Here‚Äôs a screenshot of live ants crawling out of the cake. There‚Äôs no option to share videos. Sorry to gross you out, but you‚Äôll thank me for saving you."
305646,"Whipped is one of the most famous bakeries in def col market but my experience was bad af. The staff's behaviour is so bad. I was delivered a burnt cake and it was smelling bad. I asked for a replacement but I didn't get. Plus, the way the staff talks is just unacceptable. I'm so mad rn."
305646,"Whipped at Defence Colony is the smaller branch of the best bakery in the cityüíØ  The quality of desserts here is quintessential and it is the same as served in the G.K II branch (as the kitchen is located only at the main branch)üôÉ  I always order from here whenever I want to curb my sweet tooth as Defence Colony is nearer to my homeüòé  You can literally choose any dessert from the menu and you will not be disappointedüò¨ The prices are on the higher end but then the quality makes up for itüëå  Must try desserts are:  1. Triple Decker 2. Chocolate Mud Cake 3. Strawberry Seduction 4. Brunette 5. Chocolate Venom 6. Chocolate Sandwich 7. Red Velvet  Btw, the reason why this place is so famous is because they serve the best cheesecakes that I've had, at least in indiaüôÇ  My recommendations are:  1. Butterscotch 2. New York 3. Banoffee Pie 4. Chocolate Chip 5. Blueberry 6. Strawberry 7. Queen of Hearts  P.S I'd recommend to visit the principal branch at G.K II if you want to go out for desserts as this outlet hardly offers any space to sit, moreover the variety is a tad bit extra over thereüòá  This outlet is more suited for take away or getting goodness delivered to your doorstepüòä"
18423145,all thali are good special; thali and delexue thali comfort price and also test is too good . a i have weekly 3 to 4 days i have ordering this restaurant
18423145,Wow!! We loved the food. And the staff was very nice! Everybody has to go to this Warung because I think it's one of the best out there and you pay nothing and you get a great smile! Thanks
18423145,great thali sp thali and excutive thali . kadhi paneer tasty . over all comfort menu items prices for student great paisa wasool food very good teste
1819,AMAZING SERVICE ! THIS PLACE IS LIKE YOU ARE LIVING OF INDIA BECZ THERE ARE VERY FEW PLACES LIKE THISS  THEY HAVE WELL NICE BAR AND OUTDOOR SITTING ü™ë WITH 4-5 tables  AMBIENCE IS TOTALLY AMAZING üòâ ü§§ü§§ AND I HAVE TRIED THERE VEG SPAGHETTI üçù With WHITE SAUCE  üëåüëå
309788,The overall feel of the place is good. It has the essence of an Irani cafe. The food menu has a lot of variety and most of the items are good. The washroom was clean too.The sitting is not very comfortable  but doable. Staff is courteous.
309788,This place soo good and it serves the yummiest food. I ordered palak patta chaat which was the best and so crispy. And vada pao was also pretty good. Price is affordable but not that much economical
309788,"Follow @ludhianvifood on Instagram.  So here are the 4 items I tried, 1. Palak Patta Pakoda Chaat 2. Chilli Cheese Pav  3. Sekanji Bin  4. Khari Biscuits . Palak Patta Pakoda Chaat and Sekanji Bin were just outstanding. Chilli cheese Pav was tasty too but it didn't justify the price tag in terms of size for me. Khari Biscuits are simple flaky puff biscuits and go amazingly well with the tea.üëÖ"
309788,It was a pleasant experience eating at this place. Portion size and taste was excellent. Will definitely visit again. Special thanks to Mr. Khemraj for serving us with courtesy and care.
1614,Had this peri peri pizza once again because I absolutely love it and also had the vodka penne pasta which was too delicious. The ambience is  great too.
1614,The most amazing pasta is big chill‚Äôs baked cheese pasta. It‚Äôs one of the best for all the cheese lovers . It has a great taste with a blend of perfect  italian spices and herbs. Not forgetting the garlic bread it‚Äôs soft and chewy and a perfect combination to the pasta. Please go and try
1614,Undoubtedly the best. This is my go to place when I am in the mood for a nice yummy pepperoni pizza or a good vodka and chicken pasta. They have good variety in dishes. Great service and food top quality always
1614,Big Chill is one of the finest places in the area. The food is superb and the staffs are friendly too. must visit for all
1614,"Awesome food from a good BIG chilli had a awesome time there. Been with my friends and absolutely love the food and customer service they provided, affordable also"
8244,The Big Chill is almost a sort of household name in Delhi. My favourite would be the white sauce pasta (with a side mashed potatoes and An add on if chicken and bacon) as well as the jacket potato with bacon.  Apart from these I‚Äôve found other things to be pretty average though the Bailey‚Äôs tiramisu is not bad (far better ones can be found in Delhi). Their waffles too ordinary.  However due credit can be given to their thick shakes and blueberry cheesecake.
8244,"Big chill has a retro Italian inspired ambience  with posters of classic movies hanging on the walls.  The service of the caf√© is prompt and they don‚Äôt make you wait for a long time for your food.¬†  The food is to die for! We ordered for the following dishes and none of them disappointed us: - Fettuccini quattro Formmagi - This creamy pasta has the right amount of cheese, seasoning and freshly saut√©ed vegetables.¬† Me&Mine Rating - 9/10  - Brownie shake - Just three words would describe this shake aptly: Thick. Filling. Chocoholic.¬† Me&Mine Rating - 9.5/10¬†  - Penne with mushrooms and blue cheese - This is a must try for all the cheese lovers. The cheese oozes out of the pasta!! Me&Mine Rating - 9.5/10"
844,The offer both veg and non veg food Must try their malai chicken. The place have a limited area sitting Taste of food is good but the price is too costly.
844,"This is a very good restaurant. To come along with your family and the food here is very tasty. The biryani here is very tasty. I came here with my friend. We have for the first time Khan Chacha and everything was very good, that means the food is very Delicious and I will definitely recommit everyone."
844,"Always worth the wait and money is the rolls from this place.always the perfect taste,perfectly coocked and what notü§§‚ù§Ô∏è"
307802,"The Spaghetti Manchego Wheel was 5/5 straight up. They weren‚Äôt shy with their garnishing either, made a whole show out of it and it was pretty impressive #cravingsatisfiedüòã"
307802,The Spaghetti was served live in front of me by the chef as he swirled the pasta in a wheel of Manchego cheese made of goats milk. Sadly I wasn't a fan of this but loved the presentation and ambiance.  Follow me on Instagram @arugarueats for more reviews.  #eatwitharugaru

7227,This is an amazing restaurant to visit with friend and family It has an amazing vibe  The ambience is amazing The staff is beey cooperative The food is also very tastyyy  I was overall happy with the experience Had an good eve
7227,Presenting you all the special otb Burger. The taste is super yummilious. Presentation is over the rate. Totally in love with this burger.üòç
7227,The taste is super yummilious for this otb special Burger üëåüëç  Ambience is too attractive for short accumulation gathering ‚ù§Ô∏è
7227,"Tried this drooling mutton biryani with curd and salad. The ambience and service here is amazing. Apart from the presentation of the biryani , the taste of the biryani was amazing and is the best mutton biryani have ever had in terms of taste , presentation and everything."
300656,"Another favourite place for breakfast these days, love the ambience and the food. The staff are courteous and the food tastes the best. Weekend breakfasts are best here"
300656,I ordered bloody marry which was not upto the mark. Vodka level was high. The place is awesome with decent ambience and fancy crowd.
300656,"I was in the mood to unwind, and ended up being in one of my favourite areas- Khan Market. I didn‚Äôt really want to eat anything; just a drink would do. So after walking through the all too familiar lanes, I decided to head to Smoke House Deli for two reasons: 1) I‚Äôve been to their other outlets and really like their food and ambience, and 2) they had happy hours going on! The place wasn‚Äôt too crowded when I entered (then again it was around 6.30pm), which perfectly suited me. They serve a complimentary bread basket with a delicious assortment of breads with herbed butter. To drink, I ordered one Whiskey Sour, which tasted great! (Thanks to the happy hour, I got two for the price of one). Now being the foodie that I am, I couldn‚Äôt resist ordering something to eat as well. So I ordered their vegetarian curried lasagne. Although it was prepared well, it seemed like an Indian tomato gravy was used for the lasagne (like how Shahi Paneer would taste). It turns out, the word ‚Äúcurried‚Äù in the name of the dish signifies that the tomato sauce would be Indianised, so of course the lasagne tasted like it was made from Shahi Paneer gravy! If you like this sort of flavour, you‚Äôll enjoy the lasagne. I didn‚Äôt know this earlier, and since I prefer my lasagne Italian rather than Indian, I requested the staff to have it changed. I really appreciate that they offered me to replace it with something else on the menu. So I decided to go for half-and-half pizza, where one part was olive and mushroom, and the other was Caponata with Manchego and Feta. Totally loved the pizza, especially the Caponata one (it was loaded with veggies and cheese!). The crust of the pizza was so crispy even until the last bite of the pizza! Let‚Äôs just say my unwind 101 was successful. Staff was courteous and service was prompt. Would totally recommend checking this place out if you haven‚Äôt already."
300656,"We had a scrumptious lunch at this outlet, specifically the Mushroom Stroganoff and Spaghetti Arrabbiata! A big thank you to Mr. Kanwer for prompt and efficient service."
2632,Arrived very late ( estimated time was 7:47 and arrived at 9:10).  Chicken in the dumplings tasted stale.
2632,I just love this place . Special chilly Prawns with fried rice this is my conman order whenever I went this place .  I had lots of memories which are my favourite.
2632,"If one has all the love for noodles , guys please go to this place and try the pan fried noodle in schezwan sauce . Though all the dishes were good but this one certainly made my day . It was a little on spicy side but it had a burst of flavours in it . The noodles were tossed in a curry which them taste juicy and quite saucy. Truly mesmerised by the taste . Would surely love to visit again for the food! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2632,I went there for first its such a lovely restaurant . Bartender Vivek made by day with guavagoto. I will come again asap for amazing drinks
2632,"Food was amazing , ambience was good, love the place"
3406,"Nicoise salad,  ¬†it excludes cooked vegetables,Raw green beans harvested in the spring, when they are still young and crisp, may be included   Must try Do visit"
3406,"I really like the food here, but it's really not a budget place to have a meal at. I'd quite appreciate it if prices could be lowered a bit to make it more student friendly, because that will usher in a lot more youngsters to your cafe."
3406,good service.. thank you
3406,"Their pizzas are delicious,Their toppings are simple but just enough to give you the taste you need for great pizza. Had delivery a few times and their service is alright. Reasonable prices, and great portions."
3406,the carbonara leaked into the rest of the food
313207,"Yummiest pizza, delicious LIIT, and the most mouth watering veg spaghetti pasta ever üòçüòç"
313207,We had ordered House Special A Favourite Pizza and the Shitake Mushroom Risotto. The pizza was surprisingly square and delicious! I loved the risotto as well. The shitake mushroom were great to taste! Would love to visit again! üòã
313207,Who knew potatoes and cheese could be a combination! Well coordinated I must say üòÅ. It looks like egg but trust me my friend. It's ain't egg. A must try.
313207,"Recently i visited Smokey BBQ and Grill in Khan Market.   We ordered Chicken Ham &Cheese Burger and Bacon wrapped Pork Sausage Hotdog.  The Burger is extremely huge , bigger than my handüòÇ comes with french fries and salad. The burger tastes amazing. Trust me the burger is a complete meal and it can easily fill your stomach butterflies.   Coming on Hotdog. The hotdog was crispy and again they also came with French fries and salad.   Coming on Ambience which is quite average. Decent sitting area with good lightning.  Now Service. The service is good. But they usually bring all items at same time so items are not hot anymore. Do tell them to bring items one by one.   Ambience Rating:3/5  Food Rating:4/5 Overall Rating:4/5 (Just because fries are too yum)  Follow @yehdillihaimerijaan on Instagram  for my food journey"
313207,Ambience was really fantastic
9618,"A simple caf√© in Khan market, Blue door is a place one can go to enjoy an intimate meal.It's interiors are rather likable.¬†The staff is polite and the service is expeditious.However, the food was slightly disappointing.¬†We ordered for spaghetti alla carbonara which was bland and greasy.¬†The garlic bread served along was comparatively good in taste.¬†The portion size was decent¬†Spaghetti alla carbonaraMe&Mine Rating - 7/10  Crepes  Me&Mine Rating - 7/10"
9618,"It was a nice surprise to find this place. I have one of the best salad of the last 7 years ive been living in India. Even simple toasted bread was flavourful. My friend ordered her veg sandwich, served with fries. My other friend unfortunately didnt like much the crepe because of too much black pepper. We shared a beer too. Price was bit higher than expected (more than 2700 rs) but I will definitely go again for the quality of the food."
9618,Don't waste your time and money here...food quality was pathetic...y is it even in the menu
9618,Loved going to the Blue Door cafe and trying out their Risotto and Cheesy Garlic bread. Both were super tasty and value for money.  Do try it out.  Follow me on Instagram @arugarueats for more reviews.  #eatwitharugaru
304931,"great food. But the only reason I am giving the worst possible rating is for their policy towards kids. They do not allow kids under 10 in the main dining area for dinner. When asked, I was told that kids create a ruckus and spoils the dining experience of others. But strangely this policy is not applicable during lunch as according to them lunch time is not busy. Their other reason for the policy is because others are doing it., which is a great way of shedding responsibility and accountability, particularly in India!. I have been to this place numerous time and adults have been equally loud and boisterous if not more than any kid I have seen. Spoils the whole idea of ""family"" experience. Whatever warped idea of ""dining experience"" they are offering, ""aping"" some concept, or ""pandering"" to the whims and fancies of some ""clientele"" they wish to attract, they certainly aren't going to find a patron in me anymore. And I encourage others to not condone such policies, be it anywhere."
304931,"Beautiful place! Lovely interiors and the food is yum! Tried the Guppy set lunch, totally value for money and very healthy and tasty too"
304931,"My first visit to this place has been outstanding. The ambience was stunning, it had very light hearted yet impactful feeling to it. The service was not too prompt but the waiters were mannerly and very well spoken. Having a long wait time to get your dishes is no problem here, you can sit and chat or get creative with origami that they provide.  We tried their black rice California sushi, it was truly delightful. Their 5 Mushroom ramen was great, the broth was rich and had buttery texture. Everything in this bowl blended very well together. The Matcha pudding was the highlight for the day. It was absolutely blissful. The pairing with toffee sauce is to be complimented! In desserts we also tried Tokyo honey toast which was really good too. Although it seems the toppings are random, they go quite well together. For drinks we had their guppy green ice tea, which was a combination of matcha and lemon. It was definitely very refreshing and new for us, liked it a lot.  Will definitely visit this place again. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
304931,"It's the worst buffet I have eaten, dhaba good is better"
4741,Amazing pizza. This was some of the best pizza. Drinks were very pricey. Service was great. It does take about 20-30 min to get your order on table so dont be in a hurry. Atmosphere is nice.
4741,They serve some seriously amazing keema pav n phad thai. Went there for lunch with my sister. We enjoid every bit of the food served. The keema pav was amazing n so was the phad thai. There cocktailsüç∏ are surely a must try. Dessert martini was very exotic. Well the menu states they have desserts but wen asked they did not had a single item from the list. All that they cud offer was brownie with ice cream. I think the management needs to work on this
4741,Pathetic service! Despite having just 3 occupied tables they Serve after 35 mins of placing the order. They got the soup after the main course. Sheesha comes after 50 Mins and still had to be changed thrice and still was the worst I've ever had. There is no manager at the outlet on a Saturday night. And the captain Mr. Ajay Singh instead of accepting the mistakes argues unstoppably. Never returning here. Highly disappointing.
4741,Not a fan of this place.  Seems all dingy most of the times. Really needs a makeover. The location is amazing.  They should capitalise. The service is slow if you order too much food.  Maybe its just focussing too much on serving drinks.  Service needs to be quicker.  Staff is always courteous. Thats a plus.  Capitalise on the location. Redo the interiors maybe.  Thumbs down as of now. Lets see if they change in the near future.
4741,Boom box is like full of music and energy when u enter the DJ is always on the roll. The hookah had good smoke though food is bit sloppy but the place is good for a nightlife and some good music and booze
4404,Taste is so good
4404,Most visited article that is not about a website nor pertaining specifically to the United States: India Single-day views
4404,The property is really good. It gives a nice heritage feel. But the inside seating is a bit congested though outside sitting area is good and quiet. Though the food is highly priced but definitely not worth it. One can go to this place for business meetings. Service is nice.
4404,Yellow Brick Road serves some amazing and delicious food. They have lovely ambiance and good quality food.

307799,"Being a food lover I always feel the need to try out something new always, so went with my friend @khushboo surolia, she and my sister our my food people . I tried pad Thai noodles of this place in Khan market and the taste was very good, the noodles were well cooked with an extraordinary taste , it had peanut and spinach in zit they were real pleasure to my mouth also I tried chilli chicken which was one the best ones I have had, properly cooked so used and flavoured! Enjoyed it out here! Must go if you love trying‚ù§Ô∏è"
307799,"Visited this place after looking at reviews on zomato but i was rather dissapointed by the food...The service was good, staff was super courteous, Portions were Superb but the taste wasn't upto the mark !! The dimsums were superbad !! I will definitely not visit this place again.."
307799,Wanted to visit a decent place to celebrate friend‚Äôs birthday and we stumbled upon this place. Comfortable sitting and courteous staff made our experience great. I like the ambiance and the food was good.  Ordered Margarita 4/5 Pizza 4/5 Chinese Platter 3/5 Cheese and jalape√±o Nachos 3/5.
307799,The ambience was really good and have enjoyed the food the most
307799,Priced very high and taste could be so much better...like chole masala in rice noodles....
313299,Perch is a perfect place to have your evening coffee and has an amazing ambience and loved this place a lot for it's ambience and hospitality.
313299,"Major Throwback to winters and this cup of Cappuccino from @perchindelhi  The cup is huge and has coffee enough for two people to drink. üòÇ They have their own grounded coffee and the flavor is quite distinctive, the banana bread and cookie served along is delicious also their other desserts and selection of wine is bomb."
313299,"Perch is a pretty looking cafe in the quiet street of Khan Market. While it takes in high rating on its ambience, it was the breakfast menu I am disappointed in. First of all I thought the options weren‚Äôt exciting enough! We ordered a smoked chicken Vietnamese Sandwich and a Salmon and cream cheese sandwich. While the salmon and cream cheese sandwich was good but nothing great, the Vietnamese sandwich was just too dry! The best thing about the salmon sandwich was the potato fried accompaniment which were amazingly crispy and flavourful and needed no sauce to accentuate the flavour.  Along with the sandwiches we ordered Vietnamese coffee hot and cold coffee with coconut milk. Both were nice. One thing I really liked was the option of milk from almond to soy to coconut they have the lactose intolerant covered. Overall a pretty place to go, will maybe try their regular menu once."
313299,"It‚Äôs a nice cafe provided you have the taste for such places- the food is wholesome and nice but the menu is limited.  Drinks on the other hand, have a wide array. They have a continental and classy ambiance and the menu sure does resonate with the same."
303958,"Food was really delicious and mouthwatering . Nice view of Main red light Mahipalpur from windows. I ordered here Deluxe thali  it was really testy there are almost seven items in the thali everything is amazing. There is one person who served me name sukhdev Singh Rana  . He is very polite and humble person he also suggest you , if you‚Äôre unable to understand menu . I would like to recommend to you all at list come back once again here . Staff is also here friendly . Thank you team of Mr. Prabhu."
303958,"Not recommended at all. So abusive staff and the guy behind the counter is so ill-mannered. I just told him that I was in a hurry and he started abusing and yelling on me. The food and cakes is also pathetic. Rotten food, Shahi paneer has peanut gravy instead of cashew nuts. Cakes are not at all solid and just look attractive while they're not from inside. NEVER WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS RESOURCES HERE!"
303958,"Ordered food from Mr Prabhu and the food was delivered right on time.  And it was so tasty their Dal Bhukara, Paneer Tikka Masala to their Veg Do Pyaza everything was delicious and tasty.  One of the best North Indian food I have had from Mr Prabhu."
18333396,"very bad, ridiculous, unhealthy don't food any order from this restaurant"
18333396,very bad experience. you need to do something zomato people as this shop is not supposed to be in your list. they are really doesn't care about anything related to customer service and food service manners.not even like local dhaba in india usually in which we had experienced earlier. you can judge it by its rating. then why you keeping and supporting shops like this in your list.??
18333396,Food was pathetic. I can't even smell the food not advisable at ol
18333396,worst food ever.  i think u have thr bulk of oil and that was so much bad and the taste was also too much down to the earthü§îold make sure next time u will not add much more oil in  the food and the sambhar was too sour.
18333396,Really bad service and dont forget you people are in customer service and your staff was really bad.Hire some educated people who know the place nicely and who can talk properly never ever going to order food from here  pathetic pathetic pathetic.if i can rate less than this can i will rate it below -
18416830,This place is located at new delhi mahipalpur....!!! The quality of food was superb.... Awesome food with very reasonable price...The service was good ... Highly recommended must try once... üëçüèªüëçüèª
18416830,"Ordered the food directly to the cafe rather from any app which costed me in delay and quality of food. The last time when i ordered from a food app the food was really delicious but this time it sucked big time. Fries overcooked, Pizza size became small(compared to last time) no salt in entire food. This gave me a learning that trusting such places to order directly is of no use.  Icing on the cake we asked for the bill but didnt recieve any."
18416830,It's the place to be. Excellent service and some really nice snacks at reasonable prices. Thank u guys for making the evening. Will be here back again.
18416830,"I love this place. ¬†I have tried Pasta, burger, sandwich tea and coffee. Each item from menu is very delicious and on reasonable rate. Hosts are also very good nature and always ready to help. Wifi is an additional facility. Cafe is well maintained and space is very clean."
18416830,Cool place nice food with good music... m&s cafe for u all guys.‚ò∫ Menu Club sandwhich chicken Club sandwhich veg Sandwhich chicken Sandwhich veg Aloo tikki burger chicken burger French fries Pasta arabiatta!!!
4315,Went to this place with my friends for dinner. Chicken wasn't perfectly cooked. Ambience of this place is also not so great. Price is reasonable
4315,"First of all the ambience of the place was below average compared to the price they are asking for their food. Secondly the staff was cooperating enough to provide us everything on time. Finally the food was good according to the price. we ordered tandoori chicken, mutton biryani, chicken lababdar, chicken seekh kabab and the food was very good except chicken lababdar as this was very different from actual lababdar chicken. Moreover mutton biryani was not at all biryani instead it tasted like mutton pulao. Best thing about this place was tandoori chicken which was very good in all aspects. Also chicken seekh kabab was good. As this is my first review so i was focused on eating rather than clicking."
4315,"The food quality is good. We tried tandoori chicken and biriyani. Chicken was great, freshly cooked and well presented. And biriyani was well roasted in butter. Overall it was nice experience."
4315,"The Tandoori Night is located at a prime location of NH-8 underneath Mahipalpur flyover. It's a dhaba that serves North Indian and Chinese cuisine. The first thing that you'll notice is the unhygienic seating area. Yes, it's not clean and hygienic at all. Maybe, then you will think about carry away option. But the moment you look at their kitchen, you might reconsider your thoughts.  They North Indian gravy items are although above average in taste and quite alike Dhaba style. Paneer methi malai is good in taste. Other items, such as breads and Chinese are also OK in taste but not that good in quality.  If you are a vegetarian, don't dare to eat here because I ordered a paneer gravy dish once and I found a  small piece of chicken in it. Being a non-vegetarian, although it was not a big issue for me but it spoiled my mood completely. They have the same cooking pan/utensils for veg and non-veg.  Ambience is the worst that you can think of. Service is pathetic and staff behavior is also rude. Overall, you can avoid this restaurant for many reasons."
4315,Its a prime location shop in mahipalpur. No such good experience I got to remember. Everything here is just an average. Sitting place and food here is just like dhaba. No such great taste to eat. I visited this place with my friend but did not enjoy the food.
18311961,Kuuku the is known to a dhaba but food and service is like restaurant comfortable seating friendly service food is amazing with taste and aroma will win your heart. I strongly recommend to everyone to enjoy the affordable food which doesn't reflect your pocket in notebandi time......... Hats off to kuuku dhaba....
18311961,The test of really good and amazing and very very thanks to cash less paytm accepted in dhaba I am full in joy food I have come to three days to Mahipalpur and near by all dhaba food testing but this place is food I love it enjoy @
18311961,Good food and very meet and clean compare to other dhaba in Mahipalpur I visit again and again with friends for my meal it is good for office people's who don't want carry their lunch and dinner
18356811,"The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. We especially enjoyed with Mutter paneer and Lachha paratha. It was delicious and exactly what I ordered.  ¬†A very good experience! Add this to the best dining in Vasantkunj, ND on a gorgeous Fall day, and it adds up to perfection!  We highly recommend it."
18356811,"Pathetic food, they don't know how to make Chinese food, both fried rice & Manchurian were below standard, no taste no quality, please save yourself & order from somewhere else.."
18356811,"Awesome restaurant, tasty food , must visit I loved this place and I'll visit again n again. Staff is very polite place is also at perfect location"
18356811,Really pathetic crispy corn. I am really disappointed. Taste less crispy corn. Portion size is also less. Waste of money. The food is completely burnt. Really very pathetic. It is my first food oder with this outlet and it's really bad experience.
18356811,"Ordered somedays back from this place had a very bad experience with their chapattis which were not properly cooked. The gravy item was ok but we literally had to throw all the chapattis as they were so bad and were not worth eating we felt like we are eating uncooked flour. I won't recommend this place to anyone atleadt for delivery. The food was delivered on time so I won't say anything about that, Zomato did their part pretty nicely.  Taste ~ 1/5 Delivery ~ 4/5 Value for Money ~ 2/5"
9097,Quality- 2/5  Quantity-3/4  Serving-1/5  Hygiene-1/5  Ordered pav bhaji from this. Taste was ridiculously bad. Bhaji was full of water. No proper hygiene.
9097,Great food. Do try the Paneer butter masala with laccha parantha. Slow service though but compensated by the food . Thali is also good here.
9097,This is an on road restaurant with ample sitting arrangement. Serving local Indian street food items. Foods are prepared in front of your eyes. Hygienic food. I tried pao- bhaji which is one of my favorite and it was good in taste but not the best. Can visit once if want to visit any new location.
9097,"A great place for Indian sweets and snacks. Everything is cooked fresh in front of our eyes which is a plus point.  Jalebis are absolutely tasty and sweet and flavourful. The Samosas are crispy,hot and yumm. Overall a good place if you wanna grab a quick bite."
9097,This has to be the fake Bikaner as when I was recently here I ordered some sweets and they turned out to be really bad quality. The milk cake tasted very synthetic. The same for the chena murkhi. The outer covering for the gulab jamuns were also very hard and the items were not at all fresh. To top that all we paid 700 for the lot we ordered and when we went back with the sweets the shop keeper did not entertain us at all. We were told that the items were not stale when we were given those. It was very disappointing how this whole situation worked out for us. We were just not pleased with the service and quality of the items and I know that I am not coming back and that is for sure.
9141,"Full credit to their service and polite nature of the staff and owner. Their food is not bad, about average and some dishes are below average as well. While the egg curry is definitely the best item in their menu. The taste is good and they prepare it fresh. It's not very hygienic but far better than the street food. I had been a regular customer at this restaurant for few years. The ambience is bad and there isn't anything to tell. Overall, the food served here might not be great but the service and owner's behavior is very good. Moreover, it's a very inexpensive pocket-friendly restaurant and good for students and bachelors."
9141,The food is very testy and atmosphere is not bad. owner is so friendly. so over all is not bad. and price is so lowest. so you can try.
9141,The food over here is not so bad n again if you are a true foodie then it's also not so good. However perfect if you are hungry and you have options left with.
9141,"If your are looking for food at a affordable price, then this place is a bingo...... The taste and the customizable options for food is the turn ups for the restaurant, and also the owner is also too responsive and friendly. The only thing that are the comes under major dislikes for the restaurant, is the improper seating capacity of the restaurant. So my recommendation is if your are looking for delivery, then this is good option that can be considered....."
7317,Nice and quiet ambience. Convenient location and variety are the plus points considring which you tend to forget the rates which are a little on the higher side.
7317,Pathetic food illitrate staff no manners. Pathetic service. Please do not visit even you have any kind of budget. Street food just outside is better and the charges are like a fine dine.. Check the bill in the photos. I asked for onion masala dosa he gave me masala dosa with onion on top. It took 20 min to make dosa.
7317,"One of the dirtiest places on earth and impolite staff. I wonder how they are still surviving. Unhygienic environment, used and soiled plates and cutlery given along with food. And still expected service charge or tip. NEVER EVER AGAIN"
7317,There are two Bikaner in this area. This one is in Mahipalpur while other one is nearby Rangpuri. This is 2 floor building GF and FF. Sitting arrangement available on first floor. Fully aircodition restaurant. They serve Indian street food items. Nice place for families to visit. I ordered pao-bhaji. It was average but hygienic. Ambience is good as compared to other outlets in this area. Can visit once.
303851,"This place is actually with the loved ones and friends.  When the live band is on rest or break they could have played a background music either.  The food was gosh fantastic, hot and fresh romali. Yummy ...  Food - 4 Star Service - 3 Star Ambiance - 4 Star Value for money - 1 ( because live work found in dry foods )"
303851,"Wow nice bar is there 1+1 going on beer and all hard drinks,we had beer ,fried fish nd tandoori mushroom, superb tast,polite staff, specially General manager Mr Jagdish welcomed us provided best service . thanks to all staff ,must try to go there"
303851,Food is Normal..... But got hair in chilli chicken...... May be its one of there ingredients......Decided not to visit the same place again......
303851,"Barichi¬†  Located in a not-so-classy area...I would like to say it is restaurant and bar with plain interiors and good seating arrangement..has polite and attentive staff...very useful happy hours... :) we had dal makhani, raita and naan, veg kebab platter and beers and vodka (in happy hours) and was okay-ishly priced.  Very less parking space though..but staff made sure we were comfortable..a little slow service but was okay.  Sorry no photos this time as we were busy enjoying my friend's small bachelorette party... :P."
18312458,White sauce pasta was surprisingly excellent. With lots of mushrooms onion zucchini. It was really well made with rich in sauce. The pizza was so so.
18025111,The veg maggie this restaurant serves is the best. So spicy and yummy that I cant say no even when I'm full. Loved the sevings. üíïüíïüíïüíïüíï
18025111,Its a decent place where you can eat with your family and friends they deliver as well but sometimes they take a lot of time in delivering so its better to visit the place and have something there itself. They serve a variety of vegetarian food. The food they serve is good and homely. People living nearby should definitely visit this place at least once.
18025111,"Popsy‚Äôs offers a range of variety for every meal of the day. They have dedicated Breakfast Menu and almost every typical Indian dish for Lunch & Dinner, be it Punjabi, South Indian or Mughlai. That‚Äôs their speciality. Apart from food, they have a decent air conditioned dining area. Delivery option is also available."
18025111,Very Nice.. Delicious food.. Go there for 3-4 times atleast in a month.. Would recommend for small functions like B'day or anniversary parties within budget
18025111,Food  5/5 Ambience. 3/5 Service. 3/5 Rate.  3/5 Very good food .kindly try aloo Gobhi and dal tadka .food just like a Mumma food .keep it up guys üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
7307,Had dinner here. Quick service. Located in a area where you don't have much options. So found quite good. Nicely served and tasted good. Good overall
7307,Good place. Can't say much against them as they were decent in everthing they did and We were patient enough to let them take their time. So good food and prices are pretty much good too.
7307,"Their food was quite good. Can't complain as the price paid by us was pretty much upto the quality we got. Good food , good taste and once try thing. go for it."
7307,"I ordered Dal Makhani and Paneer Masala for 2 people, the order came on time but the taste was less spicy according to me, as I like more spicy food. But the overall experience was good and I would recommend it to everyone visiting this area."
305151,"Liked the name when I first heard. Its very close to my friends pg so occasionally we get our dinners from here when I am staying over for weekends. Really enjoy the tandoori chicken and yellow daal. Though their dining area has limited seating, mostly their business is by home delivery. One of the most decent place for trying non veg in the lanes of mahipalpur."
305151,"Food is not up to the mark but in area like mahipalpur this one is one of the best food  outlet n I got In last 2 year search, n 2nd is there room service. That must be appreciated"
305151,well  try it for their low  price  because   except  that  nuthing worth of mentioning
7365,Main road location near to rangpuri. Dhaba style food available. Ambience is never expected at this kind of place . food is average. Good for travelers only. Few better options are available at the same road or in mahipalpur.
7365,Value for money & daily serving quality is good. About food quality not bad as compare price
311067,Quantity is very good but not that good in terms of quality and taste of food. Dal is very bad. Paneer butter masala is ok. While ordering ask to use less oil otherwise will get the things floating in oil.
311067,"We are friends living here at Mahipalpur near to chattori zuban.Frankly speaking we have ordered the foods more than 10 times and we never disappoint with their timely delivery,reasonable price and mouth watering delicious dishes.We have tried many dishes like chicken curry,tawa chicken,tandoor chicken,butter chicken,malai pAneer,kadhai pAneer,dal makhnee,mix veg & dum aaloo.Believe me all dishes we have tried have great taste.We have never go for any other hotels and restaurants except chattori zuban."
311067,"Main road location on the road mahipalpur to gurgaon. Little visible as people use to travel at a high speed on this road by which they miss a gem on the side. As its name suggests, you will react in the same way after tasting the food available here. Few sittings is a drawback but ordering option available. Mughlai food is the USP and that is the only way they are known for. Little spicy. Hygienic items. Good option to try."
311067,"The food is delicious here, it justify its name - Chatori Zubaan. I have been there multiple times, I can recommend these dishes as these were best ‚Äì Special Paneer Butter Masala, Daal Makhani, Butter Naan, Paneer Tikka. Service is gud. I have also ordered food from my office, it was a very good experience altogether, Nice food on time and with affordable prices!!!"
311067,Better place to eat chinese and indian food. Staff is good with lots of etiqquettes and environment is also good at the restaurant. Nice place on NH 8 to hangout with friends.

18372674,"Amazing restaurant with pocket friendly food,once should not miss when you are in this area. Friendly staff with the forest ambience,you can actually find rabbits and pigeon jumping and flying around you . We really enjoyed the food and service at this place. You must try their Hakka noodles and kadai paneer and i must insist every individual to give a try on their stuffed parathas. Will definitely remind you about parathas at Murthal.  Will come again thanks for your lovely hospitality...  Regards  Pankaj Tripathi"
18372674,"very nice place to visit, good food with reasonal price and excellent service.special attraction pigeons and rabits.open restaurant with beautiful shacks."
305190,"Awesome taste of biryani , I loved the smell of all masala and the cooking of chicken was great ,I would just suggest you to better ur packaging as the packaging had some problem , rest everything was nice , food delivered before the time ,hot and finger licking food , yummmm."
305190,"Really does a clumsy place like this has to be here??? Seriously man this place might b good for people in the adjacent area, but seriously there biryani is to dry to eat. I had a single spoon and that was it. Artifical colors they use plus the rice is not moist even to eat, either one needs water or gravy to gulp it down easily."
2863,"Excellent food having for the last 25 years , still remember 2 butter nan and chicken curry costed in 1996 for 102 Inr ..."
2863,"I have been going here since my childhood place , my favourite dish is malai kofta ,daal makhmi, butter chicken , and sirka onion is best . Its my family‚Äôs favourite place."
2863,The food quality has degraded with time. Not worth for the money.
9751,"Delicious and unique cakes. State of the art and with unique flavours and mix. Very affordable when it comes to worth and quality. Rightly priced when compared with some adjacent bakeries that serve ordinary cakes at higher prices. Tried the vanilla chocolate duet cake. Loved it to the core. The sweetness was balanced and apt, and the range of flavors in mouth simultaneously made it a wonderful try. Definitely coming here again."
9751,"They make some of the best desserts to the core, I have been ordering the Arabian cake topped with almond slivers it is heavenly, the tiramisu is pick me up again kind of, the blueberry cheesecake and chocolava are comparable with Eoropean standards, next we are going to try their brand of ice creams, so far the best and premium brand in desserts, the outlet in malviya nagar is full of various cakes and savouries, staff is courteous and smiling always."
9751,It was my birthday and I bought a mango cake from them worth 500 bucks and as I cut it and gave my friends they literally spat it out of their mouths as it was stale af. I had to toss the whole cake in the bin. I never had such a sad sad birthday!
9751,I'm a dessert lover and I love the quality of the cakes they provide specially the brownie cake it is damn yummy everyone should try it I swear it's worth a try
9751,One of the best place in Malviya nagar for CAKES. The staff is very accommodating and helpful. Highly recommend there Arabian Honey cake. The prices are really good.
18272370,"Recently I happened to order mushroom sandwich from this outlet ( since i usually end up craving for it), but i needed something that is tasty and healthy both and to my surprise my delivery box had it all. The sandwich comes in with 4 pieces of sandwich and 2 dips wrapped with tasty mayo mushroom n onion stuffing. Must try if u too are a mushroom lover Looking forward to try more from them"
18272370,"Absollutely Lip Smacking tastes, and that added freshness to the sandwiches in that small budget makes Veroi Gusto a regular place to order from. Changing its location from one corner to another has been a regulat affair with this restaurant.¬†their sandwiches are well composed, the portion sizes are just appropriate for one, the food quality is consistent and only improves over the years. Further, the staff has been very careful about the food quality and other things as over the past 200 orders i have made at this restaurant, I dont think I have had a problem with any one of them.¬†They are very patient to the customer and customize your dishes the way you like it making it all the more better."
18272370,Those cakes are awesome Too delicious and quality and hygiene is superb And not so overpriced Beautiful cakes and pastriesüòç Shakes are also incredibly tasty‚ù£Ô∏è
1037,This used to be one of our favorites. Placed an order a few days ago and the experience was pathetic. All the items ordered lacked flavor. The food prices are obnoxiously high as compared with the quality. We would never try again
1037,The food is amazing but they have to fix their online order accepting service as they never accept order on time!
1037,"Horrible experience of take-away. Paneer Makhani, I can make better at home.  Their quality is too poor and presentation is horrible.  Even the roadside vendors can make better food with a descent presentation.  It was embarrassing and worst decision to order from here."
1037,The food is delicious and they have wide range of cuisine from which you can select your order The place is very clean and have very good food and hygiene standards.
1037,Decent restaurant with good ambience and friendly staff. They even serve alcohol and I think this is the only good place in the locality which serves alcohol. Good ambience so you can even come with the family and kids:) They have two restaurants (cafe Suribachi) in the same area and both are decently good!! And both serves alcohol. It's just that one is fine dining and the other is cafe/lounge decor.
18291199,The oatmeal blueberry  was pretty good! Loved the sponge ness and the airy flavour attached to it.  Chocolate cinnamon roll was okayish but it‚Äôll do the job if you don‚Äôt have another resort. Could give it a pass and probably order the entire loaf instead of a piece of the oatmeal blueberry tho‚Äô
18291199,Pathetic food quality and zero customer service. No one bothers to even take feed back
18291199,"Ordered a full heavy meal from Freshmenu because in this lockdown it is one of the few places that I can trust. As always the sandwiches were fab, the egg n cheese one this time. Chilly Paneer was the usual high quality stuff. The chocolate cinnamon roll tasted fine but would have been better if it was crisp."
18291199,The bowl I ordered was filled with rice and just rice! I had ordered signature grilled Chicken bowl and all it had was rice and extremely less chicken. Just dry plain rice with such less chicken was very difficult to eat! Moreover it was very unhygienically prepared. Both the quality and quantity have deteriorated.
18291199,Plz do not order anything from this restaurant. This restaurant's area comes under hotspot area of covid-19. You'll never know whether the delivery guy comes under exposure or not. Better stay safe.
1036,"I used to stay 250mtrs from this restaurant and have had multiple ugly experiences with them. They are least bothered about quality of food, they never delivered food on time and they were a pain to deal with when it comes to content of the order. You order something and consistently you will be delivered something totally different. What a failure, surviving by the virtue of good location."
1036,Great and very tasty food. The chicken was very juicy and the price is also not as expensive as other restaurants in malviya nagar. You should try itüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
1036,"Really shit food ü•ò oily greasy not very appetising. Last time from. Avoid, not worth the money üí∞. Totally waste of my money, never again üëéüèæ"
1036,"Delhi Heights, it cant get better.  I have visited their Gurgaon outlets, and it has been a great experience each time. From the seating to the ambiance and music played, everything just falls in place to make an excellent evening.¬† I Highly recommend the shakes and pasta they offer. Even the burgers are outstanding. I also recommend Mr. Rana's hospitality. He has been a great host.  Thank you Delhi Heights."
1036,"Very good, no frills, simple menu & quick turnarounds. Less oily compared to other restaurants in this category. Really top stuff for home deliveries. Keema Naan is A+."
307746,"Not too hot as it was expected to be because restaurant gave wrong address to the delivery boy i.e. instead of delivering to jia Sarai, Hauz khas he went to Hauz khas and this made my order delay and food became cold. Please refund my order money as it was happening second time while ordering food from your service provided. This was not a good experience for me. Thank you !"
307746,The food is not upto the expectation although the delivery time is reasonable.
307746,"late delivery, I got stone cold food. not at all happy with the service."
307746,rolls are very good and even the Vada pao was very good
18376472,What a lovely place to visit. I went to this place just before the lockdown and had some lovely juicy chicken Biryani. Totally a delight.
18376472,"This time my experience with Biriyani Blues was very bad. Today I ordered a Biriyani, that Biryani was very poor with spices which was not edible. After that I will never ordered from Biriyani Blues. Worst experience never recommend to any one."
18376472,I've ordered Briyani. They offer 500ml Pepsi bottle and one brownie during that time. But they've cheated me because it's only a crookedness to get more customers during this knockdown  I've informed zomato and put a negative  review. After sometime  they called from the restaurant and talk indecently and rudely also I have found that they deleted my review. So bad experience from biriyaniblues.
18376472,Worst biryani..never order.. no taste.. smells funny...
18348970,When I was craving for some Desserts I ordered Waffle from this outlet it was good and tasty I would love to try more
18348970,Cute little space arrangement but worth visiting place If you are craving for waffles... But the waffle we ordered was not that satisfying.. Overall try their ither waffles you will love them eating...
18348970,"The Waffles are amazing, has even the option for customizing what add ons you want. Must Try!!"
18348970,"We went craving for something sweet post dinner one night and my husband found this place for me since I'd been particularly wanting to have waffles. These guys were running a scheme, 99 bucks for anything off their menu and I think we were in luck here. Ordered their nutella waffle and hands down it's the best they offered. Crisp with a dollop of vanilla ice cream, it tasted heavenly with a slathering of nutella. Since the price was a steal, we also ordered their mushroom crepe, which according to them was their bestselling savory crepe, although I didn't find anything best in it, and banana cream waffle with chocolate ice cream which again was good but not in the league with the nutella waffle, because I love my sugar. The service was quick since we were the only customers in the physical that time, most were orders that the poor delivery boys were picking in the cold. The place is small, can barely seat 5 adults. Pocket pinch INR 297 plus taxes. And yes, am definitely going back to indulge in their nutella waffle."
18348970,This place serves very amazing fusions. I tried their: Chicken waffle- As the name is very interesting the taste was also good but not the best. I'll definitely try their other items very soon. Seating capacity is around 4-5 people.
6179,i ordered some tasty foods from this outlet. this outlet is very famous. foods was very tasty and amazing. higly recommede.
6179,"Writing this feedback for those who all are planning to visit or order ""Chicken Handi Biryani"" from this outlet. Don't place an order as it was worst Chicken biryani of my life. Half-cooked Rice served with pieces of chicken. No fragrance, tasteless."
6179,"This is the perfect place to order for one who loves kebabs. I ordered food from this outlet and my decision was right to order dinner from this place because they have really amazing menu to choose from. I ordered mutton korma, murg dum biryani. They were delicious. Highly recommended!"
6179,"I ordered chicken seekh roll and biryani ! It was delicious and the quantity was enough for two ! It is value for money . Never had such an amazing biryani , must try it . The delivery was on time too."
6179,Its a lovely place to try some quality food. Delivery is very quick and packaging was also good. Would definitely recommend this place to a friend.
1040,Today I went to Karim in malviya ngr.... I felt too much hungry . Then... I ordered to zeera rice..... Mutton korma.... Tawa chicken.... Garlic naan..... It was to healthy to eat ND very delious in taste ..... Tawa chicken was so yummy... Very sour.. But mutton corma was not good to eat.... I was very disappointed to had a mutton corma.... ... Service was do good and deliver bit was so friendly nature......
1040,"Karim's is a brand now and quality has been degraded üòê But we can still get some good Non-Veg foods there, no doubt about it. I'm a huge fan of Karim's in general & blindly rate them 5 üåü at any point of time.  Foods - 3 üåü  Restaurant Interior - 4 üåü Very good and a good place to enjoy with family  Ambience - 3.5 üåü it's main market so, anyone can enjoy a little shopping and other options are available  Staffs - 3.5 üåü Friendly  Price - 2.5 üåü Karim's is little expensive as all brands.  Must Try - ü§î"
1040,Karim serves you with their best kababs you will ever get. Delicious food and overall good service.I had an amazing experience with my family.
1040,Eid Mubarak##Lunch date with my foody friends##foodlover##day well spent##can't get over with yummy dish and amazing rotiü§©ü§©  Mutton korma and khamiri Roti
1040,I order food from karim's yesterday..zomato billed me 416 and karim's came with bill 460...they said extra fourty four rupees was for tax...when zomato has already taxed me for the food why there was extra 44 rupee's..i said I won't take the food if it's 460 because it's wrong so he called the manager and he agreed secondly as he spoke to manager the delivery guy said he doesn't have adequate change and so he said he'll come in one hour to return the remaining change never to return ... anyways bad experience had to pay extra money for the food which was billed with tax by zomato..hope others don't face the same problem..
301190,The most amazing veg rolls I have ever had ü§§
301190,Small subway. Usually empty. Delivers on time. Fresh veggies and bread. Friendly staff.
301190,Choosing between healthy food and delicious food is always a dilemma. I order food from Subways and enjoy my Cheat meals throughout..the portions are so Satisfying and cost wise really light on pocket. Best part food from this place so good for both delicious and healthy food
313206,Nizams serves the best Kathi kebabs and other food items in delhi. They have a very good and wide varieties of delicious food items available with them. There delivery service is excellant they manage to deliver food very well even in this pandemic condition. The packaging of the food is also good. Hope to order again from here.
313206,Nizams kathi kebab serves the best and tasties kathi rolls and kathi kebabs. There taste and quality is just excellant. They provide excellant delivery services even in this lockdown period. The delivery services was very good without any contact.
313206,"We ordered, Mutton tikka and paneer tikka. The chicken tikka spiciness was perfect. The paneer tastes smoothly nd yummy.  The chicken and paneer was properly cooked and soft. The food taste was awesome.  All time favorite nd was so fabulous in taste.  The quality of food was amazing. Both were amazing.  Delivery was on time And packaging was good enough."
313206,"So if you are looking for some items in this area them this a best place specifically for rolls. Nizam's rolls are best and in good price range. Must try the chicken egg masala roll and paneer masala roll, they are very delicious."
313206,"Me and my sister were looking for some items to have in the evening, and not able to find food nearby due to lockdown but this outlet Nizam's kathi roll was Delivering food so we ordered egg roll with paneer masala and chicken roll with egg. Delivery was done by zomato, package was clean and packed properly. Rolls were very delicious. Really Amazing."
5726,"Giani‚Äôs is our go to place for ice creams. This is a must try place if you are an ice cream fan. Their belgian chocolate, blueberry, coffee and Giani special is a must try."
5726,This is a must try place if you are an ice cream lover. Good quality ice creams and they have a variety of flavours to choose from. Blueberry and coffee are a must try.
5726,Giani's ice creams are always the best for me. I really enjoyed the crunchy dark chocolate flavor. It has the pure and dark chocolate flavor which gave my taste buds very delightful taste.
309452,Best brownie ever hadüòç
309452,"This is the first time I ordered from this place. Ordered Veg Patty, Panner Patty and mushroom roll. I think someone needs to tell them how to heat a patty or how to keep it warm. The Veg Patty I received was warm when I received but it was completely soggy. It felt like it is a day old patty when I ate though it was not. The taste of both the patties was not that great. It's a no for this place. I am giving two stars because I haven't had their dessert plus the food filled my tummy."
309452,"Got cake for my Mom's birthday from here. The cake was average but the most important thing is that The next day my mom noticed a very long strand of hair in the middle of the sponge and cream part. She got disgusted and threw the whole thing away. So disappointed, very unhygienic food. Would urge you all not to order or get anything from here unless you want to spoil your mood by identifying hair strands in their desserts. üëéüèªüëéüèª"
309452,Good variety of cakes decently priced. They have specialized cake on order also!! Situated on the main road so easily located. One of the best in the market.
309452,Bought this red velvet cake from open open. It looked pretty but it wasn't good at all. It tasted like it was old and not at all fresh. It tasted bad. Stale and we couldn't eat it at all. My experience was not good. Hoping to have better experience next time through.
8346,Wasn't into Japanese food until a few weeks back and Iam glad I tried it. These guys are one of the best out their and their Sushi is absolutely great. It is well priced too.
8346,"Really like this place. Have ordered a few times and have been impressed each time by their food and packing. I've tried their yellow Thai curry, red Thai curry and pad thai, chicken steamed dimsums. I've liked everything I've tried. A big thumbs up to this place."
8346,"Soi thai delivers promising thai & Chinese food . We ordered mostly vegetarian stuff & we were surprised by its quality. Service was prompt & delivery was done at right time. Green thai curry with steam rice was well cooked with distinguished flavours , you cannot miss their tofu & mushroom salad which comes with twisted tanginess. Pad thai noodles were nicely done. Overall decent place for your thai n Japanese food cravings."
8346,"‚ÄúSoi Thai‚Äù roughly translates to ‚ÄúThai street‚Äù. As the founders of this wonderful delivery outlet have travelled across various parts of Asia and have also been trained in the region‚Äôs food preparation, they decided to set up Soi Thai as the non existence of quality Thai cuisine at optimal rates inspired them."
8346,"Ordered from these guys last week and although the menu looked very promising the food sadly wasn't.  The packaging was good, food looked good but flavours weren't there  The chicken Momos were terribly dry and bad to taste.  Pad Thai tasted stale and weird.  Tom Kha soup was good, actually that's the only thing I really liked. Good flavours.  Pepper Chicken was good too with scallions and pepper flavour with tender chicken. I had this with steamed rice and it tasted fine.  Quantity is good and food is also decently priced but there is room for improvement in taste and quality."
303057,One of the best bakery's in town...its invisible till you call them and get the best cup cakes delivered at your doorstep...great for the festive season and lot of personal care...it doesn't get better than this!
303057,Great option when you're planning a party. Let them know a few days in advance and dessert for any occasion is sorted...
303057,what is the exact location of this ? in which block of sarita vihar is it in ?
303057,I like It very much. It has many varieties of breads and cakes
303057,"Awesome, super perfect and amazingly tasty  One can rely on Wake and Bake for all kinds of celebrations."
309728,Used to be good earlier but lately tried chicken Seekh and sausages but they turned out to be stale. Their transportation is in a non refrigerated Maruti van. They no longer keep venkys.
309728,The go to place in Sarita Vihar for restocking your non-veg inventory at home. Also on the spot food items are really good. A bit expensive when compared to other similar stores.
309728,Perfect place to buy raw clean and higenic Chicken. Located at good location. Highly recommended. 5 rating for quality 5 rating for cleaning
309728,This is the place in Sarita Vihar for all monthly refills of non veg (raw) items that are fresh and always of top notch quality. Also a quickie for ready to cook and eat snacks.
309728,"A good place for cold cuts.  The chicken Ham is cut nice, thin and remains juicy . The Mexican Ham is specially good.  The sausages are appetizing.  I have tried their chicken roll ,chicken Burger and the pasta. They are quite good for a quick snack.  They also provide the green chick peri peri sauce which is a good company with a lot of food prepared at home.  A good place in the middle of the market.."
18339800,the soup was not up-to the mark...  Tomato soup does not have bread crumbs and taste is also not good...
18339800,"Awesome food, great taste. Thanks for bringing it on time. I ordered Indian tandoori food afghani chicken, tandoori chicken and naan with soft drinks."
18339800,its tasty....
18425179,worst
18339800,The wandering Minions  ordered from Deli2nite. We ordered dal Makhani and soya chaap masala along with  some breads. Each and  everything tasted super delicious and is worth each penny u spend.  They specialise in Indian cuisine and  try truly  Masters in what they do. A must try üòçüëåüëå  So according to  the minions this place deserves 5üí´üí•üí•
18357533,Sab se ghatiya khana tha... 1 sabji ke alawa sab kharap tha... Mera lose motion bhi gaya... Sahi se check kare fir khana bheje.. Did you you understand my boy
18357533,"The Rolls are perfect. Huge and value for money. The filling is juicy, paneer and chicken both perfectly cooked. Tap it up with Double Egg! Omg Heaven. Must have. It's super heavy!"
18357533,"This place has good, i mean yea.. quite tasty rolls to offer you.. the wait time is usually just a little long cuz of the long queue, especially during the evenings.. but the chicken is halal and it tastes really good!"
18357533,Tried the Chicken Tikka roll here. The taste was very satisfying as the Tikka used were very good. Often many roll corners give normal chicken instead of chicken but here the Tikka was very authentic.
18424619,Most of the times food is good and superb value for the money.  If you like presentation and all maybe not but taste and food quality wise it‚Äôs really good.  Owners are also polite most of the times but I‚Äôve realised one thing that they kind of lose their politeness if you criticise.
18424619,Great food served. Needs improvement on the mint sauce only. tried several times the quality is intact and wish all the best for this continued serving good food.
18424619,for me and my manager cum friend it s a weekly spot to go along with 2-2 patiala`s :D :D :D  not even a single time we regretted ordering from sardarji chaap.  yummy as hell !!!!!
18424619,Not Good food. I ordered masala chaap with rumali roti and the food delivered was not prepared very well ....the chaap had no masala at all but definitely the sand particle in food and so not even tasty too to eat ...total waste of my money.
18424619,It was a great experience here the chaap was amazing there speciality was kfc chaap so I recommend you that when you come here then please take kfc chap
18472439,"This number is never available to call. Kindly remove this restaurant from Zomato list of restaurant to avoid bad experience with zomato. In last 2 months, I tried numbers of time and always this is not reachable."
18472439,I am a die hard fan of Biryani but this Biryani doesnt make my flavour buds tingle. The Biryani is over spicy sending you to drink a glass of water after every spoon you take. Though they serve you hygienically but that taste is not so good.
18472439,"Small kiosk in Sarita Vihar H Block Market. Just an average biryani, nothing special, only the masala they sprinkle makes a taste.¬† Not a place for biryani lovers"
18472439,"Simply loved the taste of chicken Masala biryani , quiet affordable and hygienic stuff , garlic raita and chutney add on is must try   It's value for money offered by Biryani bot üëçüòä"
18472439,The biryani at this outlet is really very tasty. Perfect spice levels. Less oily as compared to other Biryanis ive had and somehow the taste is such that it lingers around and makes you come back for it :-). For me the most important point was that its hygienic  and they let you see their handi to to be satisfied. Point to note is their raita. I would recommed you to try it before puting it in the biryani as it makes it more spicy. A must try
18372279,Food was very bad. Ordered Chinese food. It was full of oil and tasteless. The packing was also very low quality material. Won‚Äôt ever order from this place.
18372279,poor quality of food tasteless foid
18372279,Very bad he had charged for 8pieces and delivered 5pieces of chicken and phone of this guy is not available refund my money fraud services never order
18372279,Worst food quality and the service we order butter chicken same was came after 45 mins and it was tasting like local sambar. I guess it should be low quality restaurant.¬†
18372279,Too much oily food. Not recommended.
306801,"I really wanted to see if someone served authentic Arabic kebabs in my neighborhood so I want to check out this place in the dark and dusty bylanes of Madanpur Khadar.  I asked around and found that it is present on the 5th floor of the hotel next to om palace so up I went in the elevator. We got a bit of a scare when the lights suddenly turned out on our way up but anyway we reached the top floor uneventfully.  I ordered kebab with rice and charcoal chicken. The rice was the best part, the kebab was just fine not really juicy. The chicken was absolutely dry and chewy at the edges.  Predictably, there was no seasoning in either. It was served with a tomato chutney which was literally just minced tomato but it would have been impossible to eat the chicken without it. Disappointing."
306801,Really good food and sheesha at al arabi restaurant. Arabi kababs superb a first that I have had in delhi .

308536,chowmin üçù was great !!! a must try if u are in for some badass street food Chinese....!!! don't waste your money and appetite on chicken spring rolls......over all for the money they charge...it's a do do thingy....cheers !!!
308536,"Do not order food other than Chinese or you're in trouble   This place does make quite acceptable Chinese in fact better than others. But it is extremely ordinary when it comes to other stuff. DO NOT EVER TRY BIRYANI, it looks and tastes worse than a pulao and the other Indian dishes taste disgust.   If you order Chinese  you will always be on a safer side. Just don't ry to experiment with its non-Chinese stuff not only it will save you money but also your stomach."
308536,"LFF & LK, I love ur French fries, it's awesome...specially d chutney. I think it's a lil unhygienic, pls make it a lil more hygienic. I ate those French fries but then I had a bad stomach ache. Over all good, but u need to work on hygiene. All d best!"
7905,It was raksha bandhan and wanted a cake for the same it was perfect with sweetness and decoration. I love the taste. Thanks for such a lovely cake. üç∞üòãü•ß
7905,Tha cakes are freshly baked and perfect in taste. The chocolate cake and Black Forest are really worth relishing. They take the order and bake just so fresh looking and tasting cakes. Be it any occasion Moni baker is a true saviour.
18424883,I ordered first time from brij ki rasoi . Kadai paneer and mater paneer was good as per price but need to improve butter non quality and food packaging.

305763,This place is a life saver at night. It's little hard to locate but you can always count in it when hunger strikes at night. I had mixed meat fried rice. It was amazing. The staff is very friendly and wants to cater according to your needs!!
305763,"Recently ordered food from this outlet late in the night. The food was nicely prepared. I enjoyed the onion rings and the chilly chicken. The dips provided were amazing as well but people having trouble with extra spice watch out and keep your water ready along - you have be warned :)  I loved it though.  The Keema parantha could have been better though.  i would like for it to be more filled with its outer portion to be more soft but hey its what I would like, others might find it good the way it is.  The outlet goes to my bookmark list.  Keep up the good work."
305763,had ordered chicken pasta which was simply boiled and lots of cheese was put on it..no flavour at all and the cheese was burnt too...chicken pizza also lacked flavour..sad experience
305763,"This is really amazing place to find good and delicious food, I went here with office colleague here sitting arrangements and other hospitality was amazing"
305763,Was craving for pizza tonight so ordered pizza from here .it the worst and saddest Pizza one can ever have. It was cold and not even edible .  Surely not worth a penny

307990,"If you are looking for a pocket friendly meal, okay to settle with quality and taste. This rasoi is your next stop. Online ordering is preferred. Restaurant tries best to check on hygiene. Prices are very much reasonable, and with the cost charged you may like to try it once. Restaurant should indulge more with quality, taste and hygiene. A lot can be done in all areas. Desi Dhaba Style Food - Malik Rasoi."
307990,"Good and cheap food. Budget friendly restaurant, taste is good but quality can be improved Overall good. Very useful mostly in the month end. ‚úå"
307990,Food here is pocket friendly and taste is quite good. Better to visit during lunch hours.
307990,The food over here having average taste except some dishes which really taste good.The positive thing about this restaurant is their prices which are very reasonable.
18415339,Recently had a delivery order and I must say they serve tasty food. Their menu includes North Indian dishes whose taste will never disappoint you. We had Dal makhni and aloo gobhi which was yummy and quantity of the food was also good. In breads we had butter roti which was also soft and hot. Want to try their more dishes
18415339,"We ordered tandoori chicken, paneer butter masala & Methi Chicken with lachha prantha , awesome taste, really great taste with quality and quantity."
18415339,"Atleast twice a week, i do get my dinner from the restaurant. Rating is entirely on the food quality and taste. Tandoori items are way to good, chicken tangri is one of there best item. You can try chicken masala as well.  There kitchen is neat and clean. Price is very reasonable and justified. There is no proper sitting for the family. Take away and home delivery is best option."
18415339,"Dhaba are non fancy food joints but the food they serve is amazing. This dhaba is located in Mehrauli . I ordered Singapore chowmein , sweet lassi and Paneer onion dosa."
18415339,Reasonable cheap food quality food. This is the palace to be at. I loved this place. The Dal Tadka and Spencer were fsntabullus. Coming back. I recommend it
309979,the quality i used to get is now not the same but yes price are not same price are increased but quality has decreased . my fav snack here was chicken sandwich. mutton seekh .
309979,One star. They are always understocked. Whatever I ask for is never available and the staff have no clue whatsoever. Mailed them twice and never got a reply in return.
309979,Heat it and eat it. The chicken burger and chicken sandwich is what attracted me on first sight . Just 1 chicken sandwich and your stomach gets half full. They have wide variety of kebabs. Which you can try definitely.
309979,"I can't really review a Green Chick Chop outlet, as all of them are the same when it comes to food: Frozen food, quick bites, Heat N' Eat, etc. However, I can and will rate them on their service and availability of various foods.  So far, this particular outlet has been well stocked, with almost everything on offer that you expect from a GCC outlet. They have 2 microwaves as well, so Heat and eat foods are an available option, unlike say, the outlet at Saket J-Block. They are well equipped with paper plates, spoons, forks and what not, so that's a plus point.  They haven't started home deliveries yet, even when multiple people have queried them about this, including myself. No Deliveries in Mehrauli? You need to provide that if you want more exposure.   -EDIT/UPDATE- They have started home deliveries now. They even heat the stuff before delivering, if you wish. That's great."
313073,An awesome place to visit and cool down yourself during hot summer afternoon. A much needed store in qutub area with a quality ice cream. We tried nutty buddy and kuch nahi sundae.  Ambiance: Good Staff: helpful and they know about there product and flavours hence they will be able to help you in choosing ice cream. Service: Very good. Price : Bit high 300 for 2 people including taxes. Taste: awesome.
18025093,Had lunch at Mahra restaurant near mahroli area . About the food it is so delicious. service is quick . Cleanliness is well maintained .polite staffs.

309517,"Located just ahead of Punjab national bank, Lado Sarai. I have visited this place quite number of times. Its not a big place but yes the service is fast. Really liked Chicken Biryani, Chicken Hyderabadi and especially BUTTER CHICKEN. The half serving is alot for two. Pocket friendly and tasty food. One drawback is they accept cash only. No cards. Give it a try."
309517,Good food at reasonable price that's what we all want and this restaurant delivers this all.  Their Kadhai Paneer and Afghani Chicken is must try. Both are amazing and Paneer do pyaza is also good.  Service is good too. They know how to serve.

18350159,Having heard so much about this place it was gratifying to find that all the superlatives we accurate! We had the fixed lunch menu and it was quite delicious. The service was very attentive and professional but was never obtrusive. A very vice little touch was when we said we couldn't eat any more of their delicious item they gave us a dessert of it to take home. Top marks.
18350159,"This place is one of the typical types of biryani corners that u find almost in every locality, two three tables of seating arrangement, but the quality of beeryani is very satisfactory and same is for korma. The price is very economical and the quality of beeryani is good enough, if one visits lado sarai ,instead of spending money on samosa and momos or cheap quality chowmeen , this place wud b a very good alternative for an economical non veg lunch, beeryani and korma with rumali roti is what they serve and at very economic rates"
311683,Good chines outlet with reasonable prices and hyzines are maintained.. easy to reach and comfortable to eat . All items are not available at all time but items are delicious.
18168122,"Tried out the chicken roast with parotta on somebody‚Äôs recommendation. The chicken preparation was average and the parotta almost cold. I was famished so I gobbled my meal in minutes. Was I impressed ? No !! Would I go back ? Maybe yes, coz there are still a few malbari preparations on the menu that I would want to try including their version of biryani. Hope I am second time lucky !!  Follow me on Instagram @SPICEITUPWITHSAM"
18168122,"For money anything you people are providing guys don't buy it, it's not worth like the people who are making this kind of stuff"
18409207,I love it
18409207,"Honestly, this is one of the best restaurant I have ever ordered my food and also recommend you to try their food and prompt service. Thank you!"
18409207,"One can't have very high hopes of the food at such a place, but still. I had the Desi Vasa pav- pav was really spicy and the bun was downright sweet. Not a great combo. The ""diet soya chips"" however, are nice. My takeaway, stick to the packaged things and you'll be fine. Their fresh food doesn't look very appetising and the pav didn't taste that great either. At Rs70+ for a small, not very tasty bun and no seating, there are other, better options nearby."
18478992,"Great Food, Good Service i like it so much please continue the same first time we go their with my family but now i always going their with my friends"

312983,they do home delivery for average food......when not in mood to go out to...then this would b a good place to order food....not great in taste....but OK
312983,"Their Chicken tikka and tawa chaap is pretty average Other than that i dont think anything is that good. Their roti/naan's are just horrible. Doesn't do justice to their pricing, also the packing is just fine. Don't expect too much. Takeaways only"
312983,Late delivery... waited atleast an hour to het my order... ordered tandoori chicken and u got chicken curry instead. .. delivery boy not carrying change. Worst place to order..
312983,Excellent service and finger liking food is here. I order the butter chicken and some other briverage and they delivered it within minutes .

18175282,One stop shop for all the non veg woes. Chicken sandwich is ultimate from the ready to eat snacks. Chicken salami is also a good option. This place is heaven for all the gym-goers as they get their protein under one roof.
18175282,"Green chick chop is quite a famous outlet for raw meat, heat and eat packs and quick bites. I have tried a lot of stuff from here. All is tasty and fresh. Worth a buy. Murg kali mirch tikka is a must try."
18175282,Big list of processed and packaged food items. They also chop fresh mutton and chicken. Delivers to home too and you must try their kebabs and salamis.
312753,"One of the best foods, I ever had. This is simply one of the best resrtautrants for having lunch, dinner etc. The foods over here are reasonable and good in taste"
18277163,Food is delicious // Homely Food // they need to improve sitting ambiance and cleanliness. Would love to recommend the food to all who are staying near by specially
18175299,"A small bakery shop in Main Market Ghitorni selling some awesome cakes, pastries and snack items at a cheaper rate. For friends' birthday, we used to purchase birthday cakes from here only and the taste never disappointed us. Their Black Forest pastry is simply amazing and their Paneer Puff is just wow though they need to improve the filling inside their Potato Puff."
18175297,"Good food but spicy,rest you can ask to serve as best whichever suits you. Good food but spicy,rest you can ask to serve as best whichever suits you."

18175297,They serves one of the best kadhai paneer in south Delhi. Must try it once. Tell them before hand to make it less spicy and they will serve you the best!
18175297,"Whenever, I pass through this place I can always see samosas being taken out from hot oil.. I just enjoy watching that and feel hungry too.. Once I bought their samosas ( 10 Rs). Their samosas were spicy and it had peanuts inside bt that didn't add to its taste.. overall , it was a fine experience... Here also mosquitos roam around.."
18175297,"A typical dhaba, in terms of the desi look and taste. Though this area does not offer much in terms of food, this dhaba is a blessing in disguise! From Dal makhni to aloo parathas, from samosas to chaat, I have tried almost everything and it all tastes good and light on your pocket too!"

18277176,"It is a decent place to eat and pocket friendly too. The thali which costs about 50 rupees is the most demanded here by the students living nearby and it gives you a sort of home like food, so its worth a try if you are looking for a monthly basis meal plan. i personally liked the butter masala paneer here which was about 80 for half plate, it was cooked with due care. However i would advise against eating chicken and egg here as they did not seem to be fresh."
18337908,One of my uncles took us to this hidden gem. This place is a located in a community club. Food is amazing. Tried their veg n non-veg platter. Their mutton seekh kebab is jus the best... simply mesmerising... and jus melts in ur mouth. Definetely coming here for more
18337908,"I think the food is pretty great for the price. I have had the PIRI PIRI chicken pizza, the PIRI PIRI chicken special burger, the Paneer Malai Tikka  and what not. Everything tasted brilliant. And the bill! It will surprise you! It's too light on the pocket and you will NOT regret ordering from here.

18489545,"I always like to dine here, one of my all time favorite restaurant. My kids too love this place.The food is filling and amazing. Will plan my next visit soon."
18489545,Rajdhani.....one of the best place to enjoy rajasthani thali with lots of variety they serve that comes with complimentary drink that is lassi.
18489545,Horrible service response. Extremely rude to customers. Should be taught how to deal with customers politely on the phone and not be abrupt and slam the phone.
18489545,"A nice ambience, homely veg food which is also delicious like heaven ! A big thumbs up to this restaurant to all veggies out there. Courteous staff adds more charm. Kudos !"
18467388,"DELICIOUS AUTHENTIC FOOD IN ELEGANT AMBIENCE. You forget you are in India when you enter this place. They offer a big range in food that can be enjoyed by anyone and still is priced reasonably. A gem. My wife ate here with her friends today, including a Japanese, who frequently visits it and loves it."
18467388,"Very cute! Very authentic... Really nice japanese food. Experiment and you won't be disappointed. But not the place for the best sushi, so have an open mind."

18489804,This place is opposite to my office and it's the ideal place to have lunch from when you don't get your tiffin... I had bought these - 1) bengan ka bharta 2) rajma 3) chole 4) paneer 5) kofta 6) dal you can get sabzi for min of Rs20. their rotis are soft and good. Their thali is for Rs 50 and really good. Students and office people come here and have their lunch...
18492029,"Went here today, saw it by chance on the way to gurgaon and stopped to try.. Turn out the taste is as. Good as the original, the staff who attends to you at the car could have more practice.. But food quality was amazing and  best of all its closer to gurgaon!!"
18492029,Yuckkk is the word. Yuck yuck yuck. It is a big blot on its original SDA. Tried it about a month and a half ago & had to take my son to the nursing home for food poisoning. This after having re-confirming the sales guy that all food was fresh. Decided to never visit any aap ki khatir joint.
18034037,Best place to have healthy food to make your diet best in worth prices. I love their chicken sandwich and chicken tikka roll. The best part is it is full of taste and healthy also.
307571,"Virgin mojito was very refreshing, the presentation was seemingly beautiful, with a good ambience and well behaved staff members."
307571,i visited both the outlet in satya Niketan as well hudson lane the food was amazing their. i had their  veg platter - 4/5 cheesy fries - 4.5/5 chilli garlic noodles - 5/5 dessert - 5/5 ambience - 4/5  budget friendly too

307571,I have tried here herbivorous platter the presentation is good and the taste is also amazing
18034053,"This place is warm with hospitable staff...the food is a little indianised version of Asian food, however everything is full of flavour and you end up enjoying due to great service.  Should try the baos and sushi, the California sushi, roast duck Bao, patty Bao."
18034053,"Have been to the fatty boa outlets at Delhi and Bombay, and it has never been a disappointment. Those who like a good sangria might just find one here. The food and the ambience both are a good reason to visit the place time and again. The Japanese cheese cake deserves a special mention."
18034053,Great baos and overall a very good menu with lots of good options. place is also nice. Warm staff. want to pop in for a meal every time I pass Sangam.
18034053,Teriyaki Glazed Chicken Bao is the yummiest and the softest open bao I‚Äôve ever had! You get the full deal here because of the perfect blend of flavours. And FYI these buns are STEAMED.   It is also one of the only few restaurants that serve Oysters!
18034053,Had a really bad experience.   Food wise I don‚Äôt think they live up to the ratings mentioned on Zomato. Food was just average. Service was not great. The guy serving us was clueless and lost most of the time.   They have an extensive alcohol menu but nothing is available when asked for. Literally 70% of it is not available. They had 0/7 beers listed on the menu. And every spirit we asked for had 1/3 brands available.   Really disappointed by the overall experience.
7060,"As we were craving some south Indian dishes we went to this restaurant, the place is very crowded at lunchtime as it is famous for its dosa. so after a long wait, we got the table for two. we both ordered masala dosa, sambhar was very tasty and all above this  I liked the coconut chutney which tastes heaven, talking about the inside masala it was also good, the sides of the dosa were crispy and crunchy so overall you can visit this place if you crave a proper south India food."
7060,Visited this with my friends. Nice place to have authentic Indian food. Overall loved the experience.
7060,Amazing experience here. Loved the food and the service. The dosa tastes amazing. Will surely visit again.

All the dishes were fresh and good in taste. And I also ordered margarita pizza and red Bull. This turns out to be a perfect combination for me. Totally satisfied."
18303832,The food was delicious. It's not much spacious and work can be done on decorating the cafe. It's reasonable and the staff is really nice. I celebrated my birthday

18228894,Went to Cafe Hera Pheri a couple of times. I'd say the food is tasty but the prices are quite high. I ordered noodles and a Oreo shake and I have to pay a 1000 bucks for that . The food compensates it though. Also the staff is okay though they need to standardize their services.
18228894,They have a really colourful ambience and courteous staff. Mushroom thyme soup is the really creamy and delicious. Their oreo shake and sandwiches are also worth a try.
18228894,"Cafe is for hukkah lovers, As there were no special food item which i have to mention here..  though the food items was ordered, the result was good in taste and nice presentation.. but i have written in many reviews of satyaniketan outlets that the music system which they have installed in their cafes are so loud that leads to create irritation. Though i love this place and service was good, hukkah was good, all food items were good.. total recommended place for hukkah lovers.."
18228894,"I ordered barbeque wings, fried rice and two drinks. Well, wings literally sucked but fried rice was okay. Service was good but the food was not as delicious as I thought it would be. And the ambience was okay. But I will not recommend this cafe to anyone as there are many other cafes in Satya which are way better than this."
18222586,Pasta and platter was so good (5/5) Plus their dip was so flavoursome (5/5) Didn't loved the ambience though (2.5/5) Service was also slow Recommended just for the food
18222586,pipeline Cafe in Satyaniketan in front of the Venky college of Delhi university is one of the most popular hangout spots out of all the other 50 cafes in the area. The staff and manager are really polite and service is extra good. The take steps like replacing your food in case you don't like it. Customer satisfaction is a really important thing and Pipeline caf√© Takes all possible steps to provide it. My favourite items :- 1) Spring rolls 2)Penne Pasta(i prefer the mix sauce oneüòç) 3)Oreo shake 4) Chocolate brownie shake(BEST I've had ever) 5)vegetable cheese sandwiches awesome with red chutney 6)barbeque Paneer tikka 8)Chilly patato Oh and did i mention they have a separate big area to dance with a dedicated DJ? What are you waiting for Go and pay a visit
18222586,This cafe serves very good and tasty food. It's fried rice and noodles were delicious and spicy. The ambience was also very good. It has a Place to dance as well. This place is so good to visit.
18222586,An average place to be honest and this is  just a feedback as a customer .... It isn't famous for anything in particular in regards to food or alcohol... The ambience are very regular and the restrooms are far from impressive ...  The place could still be doing well and not taking anything away from the people trying to run it ...
18222586,This is said to be one of the best chinese combination of all time.  The best comfort food.
309865,The desert we ordered was so yummy. We had chocolate truffle sundae (The valley of flowers). It was amazing. Must visit.
309865,If you are looking for pocket friendly food then this is one of the best option to try in satyaniketan.¬† I have not visted here so cant comment on interiors and ambience.¬† Order many times from here for home delivery and all time they have served on time with hot and fresh food.
309865,Some days ago i went to here . i had one pizza one cold coffee and grilled chaap . pizza is so yummm. i like their interior. There music and sitting place is good. i would to prefer to try this place. Lovely place . visit again
18418239,This place is a must try for burger lovers!! The way they serve the burger the whole presentation thing is so nice!! Used to be our favorite hangout place after college!!!
18418239,Great burger comes with a great taste.. It was awesome.. Great experience... Must try... Specially protein powers... Also go for mad fries.. Reasonable..
18418239,My friends told me about this place and I said ok I will try it. I ordered the Grilled Chicken burger and let me tell you it was one of the best burger I have ever tried and the fries are just delicious . This is the best burger place in the area. I am definitely coming back.
18418239,Their Nutella Marshmallows Waffle is to die for. A MUST TRY!!! Caramel Brownie shake is also good. All in all it's a pocket friendly place with a good ambience.
18418239,"A shoutout to all the burger lovers. Even though they don‚Äôt have seating arrangements, but they do have are standing tables and they offer take-away and delivery services.  This much hyped place was on my list for a quite few days, so we decided to pay a visit to the outlet, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. Burgrill has a strong hold on the range of burgers, but there is still a large variety on their menu. So we decided to order Meaty mighty salad, cheese chicken and cheese mutton burgers, crispy barbeque chicken wrap, pulled barbeque chicken sandwich, bacon chilli and cheeese fries, mozarella cheese sticks. In my recommendation one must try their meaty mighty salad and burgers, which were absolutely mesmerizing. Sandwiches and fries were decent in taste. Mozarella sticks were undoubtedly delicious and cheezy, but I was disappointed with their quantity.  We also oredered Bubble gum cola, fresh ginger mojito, strawberry oreo shake and iced banoffee milkshake. I have to admit that the shakes and drinks were worth the money spent. Absolutely gem !  Good food, curteous staff and quality service, so overall we had a good experience at Burgrill. Cheers !!"
300815,Pasta and pizza that i had from this place was mouthwatering it was too tasty and also looked very tasty. Since we all know satyaniketan is a students hanging out space this place here is too good i visited this place when i went delhi and the ambience of this place was too good...
300815,This seemed super creepy...it couldn‚Äôt decide between a sleezy cafe or a really bad escort lounge. No waiters to explain what was happening and all the windows taped up. I didn‚Äôt stay long to see if things improved...I held no hope
300815,"I have ordered only one veg pizza, it was not too good, not too bad, the taste was only satisfactory. Ambience was good. I also ordered sheesha, but I was not satisfied with the service."
312142,The service is atrocious. There is no coordination with the zomato company.  They firstly tell us to wait for 30 min becz inka khattam ho gya tha and after 1 hour they cancelled....zomato was saying restro cancelled the order and they were saying zomato cancelled it...... Worst experience ever with this restroüòëüòë I will never gonna order from here again and also doesn't recommend it to anybody
312142,Mutton Keema biryani was delicious! Kutton Keema was very well cooked and spicy! Loved it! Didn't like Hyderbadi veg biryani at all.
312142,Incomplete order delivered. Saalan was missing. Not the first time that this has happened. Multiple instances in the past also.
2215,Singapore Noodles are too yum and the chicken momos are too delicious.
2215,"I have eaten a lot from your place and it used to be very different and excellent! Recently, I‚Äôm not sure if you changed staff or whatever happened but you are not great with online orders at all. It doesn‚Äôt have the same quality as when i eat there in the taste. If you don‚Äôt want to go down the drain, please pull up your socks, i loved your food!"
2215,"This place was good before zomato and swiggy came along. I have been ordering from this place since 2014, they used to add black mushrooms, broccoli to their chicken. The other day when i ordered they gave me chili chicken with onion and green bell pepper. That's it. Nothing else. Literally waste of money"
18291230,A place in Satya Niketan to fulfil the cravings of Chaat and pav bhaji. Although I didn't like the taste and it was kind of overpriced with respect to the quality.
18291230,Horrible delivery and taste both!!
18291230,"The place was average as I was expecting too much from this place. As the name say Bombay, there was nothing like Bombay. Normal chat normal taste."
18291230,An excellent cafe with beautiful ambience and ultra friendly atmosphere. Suits your requirement and fits your pocket as well.  Interior is neatly done with chic lights on the ceiling with comfortable lighting to set up the mood for that intimate rendezvous. Ample seating space which caters for groups as well as for couples. Taste of music is good and lets you have your talks too. Bombay brunch special grilled sandwich and sev puri is a must try and quality of cutting chai is super. The only issue is with the parking space for your four wheeler which is not available. Overall a must visit cafe for all those who like to work from cafes and spend some good time around nice music and food.
18291230,"It was 7pm on a weekday, I had just stepped out of office when my colleague insisted that we tried Bombay Brunch on our way back to Delhi. As tired as I was, I couldn't refuse to her. And God, do I love her for having took me there?!  We tried their Cheese Dabeli, Paani Puri, Samosa Chaat and Chaat Platter. And believe me, with every bite that I took, I wanted to thank my colleague more. The food was genuinely that good.  Pretty pocket-friendly for a restaurant in Satyaniketan, its located right at the beginning. Hence, saving you the troublel of walking too much as well.  In my opinion, ya'll should definitely go!"
18368002,This cafe has been shut down . Would request Zomato to Please update your details. Zomato needs to be responsible enough to review places and update accordingly
18368002,Small place to hangout with friends comes with good ambience and delicious food. Reasonable pricing of both food and drinks. Food here is tasty and delicious tried fusions in their recipes and nailed it
18368002,"Well, In the middle¬†of all the restaurant in South Campus. It is a nice one through the sitting and staff is not that good still a good place to chill.¬†Try out for their burgers n momos. Still, you guys can make your menu better the best."
18368002,Please do not visit this restaurant nowadays because it is closed under renvovation. You will only get annoyed by doing so. Though nearby restaurants are goodüëç
18368002,"I was little apprehensive to visit this cafe. And when I went there, I wasn't very glad to see everything in ambience or the crowd (may be bcoz I reach a little early) but liked the wall decor only of engraved bottles in it. Anyways,  what I totally enjoyed here was their food. Food , yes you heard me right ...if you love some Continental & Chinese food then its the place here. However, one can get awesome Afghani Tandoori Momos, which I loved it totally. This place is really cheap and you can get value for money by having great food  here. Would love visiting here and recommend to the loved ones."
304162,The street food is up to the mark but some things are overpriced . Less space to sit but the food is worth it.
304162,I ordered tandoori veg momos and I found hair in the momos which looked very unhygienic. The place should maintain certain hygiene.
304162,I love these place ‚ù§Ô∏è I always knew Chowringhee serves the best rolls but they also serve the best Momos . Paneer tandoori Momos were so crispy their chutney was too good in taste üòãtheir chutney is awesome . Totally worth it to the rates ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è rating - 4.8/5
18472788,"Good and romantic place. I went with a friend. chicken momos, burger and pasta was so good and creamy. Very generous portion. I will be back to this place again."
18472788,If you are looking for a pocket friendly and Good quality of food then this restaurant is better option. I ordered for Veg noodle and Veg Burger.I must say I am amazed by thier service. The full plate of veg noodle is enough for two people's.  veg noodle - 5/4 veg burger- 5/4  will visit again...!!!
18472788,"A cozy place in the hubble-bubble of Munirka. Serves as a cool hang out place, though not very big and that maybe a good thing. Tried sandwiches and Afghani chicken momos and coffee, all very well made. Pocket friendly and peaceful, makes for a nice evening visit."
18472788,Awesome food with great location n frndly staff will give you your space to spend time with your ones.. Each n everything is perfect. U can come any time it alays welcome with u a big smile
7388,"Located at metro station Munirka, this place is good enough for some lip smacking fast food options. I tried their chholey bhature twice. The taste was really nice however they're too oily and the oil can be seen running on your plate. Rest, it'd good place comparing to price."
7388,Taste is good. Price is a little higher than it should be. Service is quick. Seating is on benches. Lots of food and beverages options available with Golgappe stall also available.
7388,It's right behind munirka association bus stop. Serves some pocket friendly Chinese foods and North Indian snack varieties. Chole bhatura here is something to look out for and the Chinese delights such as chow mien is good but oily a though.
18225831,"Owner is very rude. He dont accept his mistakes. He baked wrong photo cake at the last moment and spoiled bday. He challenged that someone who will bring a better cake then of his shop, then he will name his bakery shop to that person. I will just suggest that dont order anything from that shop."
18225831,Really pathetic cake with fungus in bread. Felt like dust particles in my mouth. Stay away don't order in cake from here. Mr. Mukesh the owner deneis it but I am attaching photos which reveals everything.
18225831,"Third rate place. First they delivered the wrong cake, but I had guests over, so decided to ignore that, but the cake tasted like stale bread with really bad quality icing.Left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth. I wonder what ingredients went into making such a pathetic tasting cake. Stay away."
18225831,Thank you so much Dee Cake Shop for perfectly customizing my 6-month Anniversary Cake. The soft and creamy texture of the pineapple cake almost melted in my mouth. I'm certainly gonna place more orders with Dee Cake Shop... üéÇ
18425739,Bread was too bad and smelly. And the worst part is blueberry was melting after keeping it in fridge for whole night.
18425739,They sent us melted damaged cake
18425739,The marble cream cake was all cream.JUST SEE THE CREAM THAT WAS IN THE CAKE... I HAVE SEPARATED IT...  The cake was poorly made.... Spoilt my wife's B-Day..... Poor show... Walnut brownies need lot of improvement......
18425758,"Quite a refreshing place to bite into a yummy snack. The sweets, the savoury all provide a wide variety of options to choose from. And it does win you some way or the other."
18425758,Aggarwal sweets in Munirka is since ages . almost 2 decade old. the best thing you can get Thier is samosa and bread pakora. rest are all okay nothing great.
18425758,"This one is right opposite to Vasant Vihar Bus Depot (there are 3 Aggarwal Sweets in Munirka). Price is average. Quality is good. Apart from sweets one can find basic food options like samosa, kachori, bread pakora etc and not to forget golgappe and tikki."
18425758,"Been here on several occasions as it is very close to and en route of JNU. They serve lunch ü•ô in afternoon and snacks in evening. A wide range of sweets are also available to choose from. I like Imarti and Barfi they make. Save puri, Dahi Bhalle and Chaat are also okay. Overall, this is a typical Aggarwal Sweet corner, like many we come across in Delhi. üçΩ"
18425758,Me and my friends went to Munirka for some workand had some snacks here with friends. The place is higenic and taste was also good at a reasonable price.
300259,"Great food, cheerful vibes  and great,cooperating staff. Totally justified cost and tasty food.  Would totally recommend going there. Loved the ambience!"
18229077,Nice. Though the place is a bit smaller than i expected the food makes up for it. This is a place to go to for the people from mizoram who misses their homefood.
18229077,"Great food and cute ambience,went here last week and had a great time with friends Really like artuitauh and the non-veg menu Should definitely try it out"
18229077,"I like this place ok. The lestaulant also very small but very smart no, the waiter also very cute and food also very niceee. I want tru kham again if I get the chance. I will surely kham and bring my friend also. Ka duhhh lutukkk!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
18229077,"The place is awesome , you can try their Sanpio its the best thing to eat there, even you can get pickles also. if you want to taste mizo food its the best place in delhi"
18357566,One of the oldest bakery with finest cakes and other bakery products. Any occasion they have their customised cake . Loved their nutella cake . All the products are reasonably priced .
18357566,"Well known for cakes and bakery items in munirka, Old and famous and have lots of options for bakery items from cakes to sandwiches...and Cakes are exceptionally good and are reasonably priced. Loved their Nutella cake......"
309509,"Once i ordered so many items from this outlet and found the great chance I mean found the great taste. Ordered veg momo, Egg fried rice, Chicken fry, Mix soup, Fish rice, Egg spring roll. All were just good in taste... Delivery was just awesome way. Thank you so much..."
309509,This restaurant is great good Chinese food and chilly potato chicken fry rice and momo and chicken fry momo  is very nice üëç  üçùi love this restaurant...... üçú
309509,Small outlet with cheap and best Chinese delicacies.                                                                  Chicken fried rice and chicken fried momos is my preference at this restaurant.                             We get it packed and then move onto my friends room so as to gorge on that.                       Ambience:3/5 Service:4/5 Quality:2/5 Quantity:4/5
18354992,Veg mein non veg yae Kya majak hai not acceptable please aap veg or non veg mix na karae I am pure vegetarian not happy with this app non veg ki list mein rakhar
18354992,I ate their noodles and cheese nuggets... I didn't like that at all... My health got bad after eating their food... The place where they make is too unhygienic....
18354992,"Sitting is okayish. Benches. Lot of food and beverages variety available. Found it a little bit expensive for the area, service and quality of food it is giving. But taste is good enough."
18354992,"we ordered spring rolls, chicken rolls, nuggets and grilled chicken sandwich ..........all of them were very good except chicken roll ........it is very pocket frndly .....a must try"
18424615,This outlet sale old sweets which is spoiled.today I purchased samosa and lassy .but lussy was spoiled it happened many times . They told me this is fresh and sold 250 glass of lassy .and don't have manner to talk with customer.i will never go again in aggarwal sweets.
18424615,"This sweets and snacks corner is right on the main road of Munirka Market. We have tried both their snacks as well as sweets. In snacks they serve a good variety. We have tried their tikki, gol gappe and samosa. None of the things was disappointing.  In sweets we tried their Gulab jamun and Besan ke Laddo. Sweets are fine but nothing extra ordinary in taste. We recommend that you go for snacks instead of sweets."
18354988,"I had ordered a chicken liver fry and 2 rice with chicken curry... firstly, they took 1 hr to deliver from munirka to arjun nagar, safdarjang enclave and the food had gone cold by the time it reached. Also, they did not deliver the complete order- 1 rice with chicken curry platter was missing and zomato executives did not even refund the full amount for it when I reported. Liver fry and chicken pieces were chewy. Quantity was less for even 1 person  I had ordered from this restaurant earlier too. Back then, even though they took time to deliver, food atleast was tastier and the quantity was sufficient.  Utterly disappointed with their current service"
18354988,Service- Home delivery.  I ordered butter chicken and pork pickle . The worst butter chicken I have ever had ......3 star just for pork pickle which was awesome but the quantity is very less as per the price ......but anyways it was so good I order it again.
18354988,Food quality was good also food was warm.
18354988,food is nice
18354988,"It was too watery, no salt at all."
18468524,"I vegetable noodles, honey chilli potatoes and chicken momos. All three dishes were disappointing. There were barely any vegetables in the noodles, the potatoes were greasy and while the momos had flavor they lacked taste. The prices are nice and low and suit the student community, but will not satisfy a more discriminating audience"
18468524,Best place for ordering a Chinese combo Thali. Very cost effective and quite tasty as well. Hard to find such good Momos in such a less price. noodles are also good. Spring Rolls were average. The only thing that disappointed me was the Veg Manchow Soup whose taste and packing both were not impressive.
18468524,"First of all I‚Äôm sorry for not adding pics.. I was really hungry and just dig into the food So I ordered chilli gobhi, chicken steamed momos, chicken fried rice and chicken schezwan So the quantities were good.. so was the quality of the food. One could tell that love was put into making the food.  They even courteously provided a good amount of tissues and some cutlery which I‚Äôve seldom seen unless you specifically ask for it. If you‚Äôre hungry and nearby Munirka go ahead and order from this place without giving a second thought. The most bang for your buck (food wise)"
18468524,"I order almost every 3 or 4th day from this place but some times they make very good, sometime very oily, some time wrong so i have mix review for this place but i like the taste. Honey chilli potato should more crispy."
18468524,"It's a very worst experience to order from the pure kitchen, we ordered Chinese combo but they provide us wrong product and whatever they provide all the stuff is stale, very disgusting and very disappointing.... Plzz don't order from this kitchen..."
18425772,Nice rolls in affordable price. Taste is average not that great. So if you are hungry do give visit this place. I think this place won't disappoint you.
18425772,I am visiting this shop from last 3 years and I always love the roll of this place. In taste and pocket friendly. Though the downside is home delivery being not available and its deep inside munirka.
18472683,"we were just passing by after knowing that we r going to miss the biryani in the mess..and guess what..we decided to try this place out and were amazed to find that such authentic south indian food is being served in our neighbourhood.we were 2 and ordered a special combo which had so mich to offer to our tastebuds.Not only the quantity was good enough,surprisingly every single dish in the combo tasted simply awesome.the utappam is a dish i never liked but when i tasted their utappam..it is now in my favourite list..i was so happy that i could find a place in munirka where u can eat sumptuous south indian delicacies under 200.The south indian owners were very polite and happy to serve.the dining area looked clean.L ooking forward to go again and explore some more dishes"
305545,One of the reasons I like staying at the Eros hotel is for the breakfast spread at Blooms You have abundant choices and it is delicious as well.!

196,Super in taste #hygeineatitsbest #their peri peri fries #new combo deals are amazing #coffee #super n best and offcourse affordable to have something.
196,Mcdonalds is the ultimate burger place... Anywhere in the world ... Any outlet in the world .... It will taste the same and it will make you feel the same .... 100% the place which serves the best french fries in the world ... The Mcafe is also awesome .....

305548,"One of the oldest and authentic Chinese restraunt in Delhi. Had the veg clear soup, the seven treasure vegetables with the clay pot vegetables. The meal was great and ended it with some Chinese tea."
305548,"Excellent eating experience.. from walking in the door and being greeted by employee, seated and drink order taken, was maybe 5 minutes. Meal was served hot and excellent taste. Server was very friendly and helpful.... Will definitely visit again soon..."
305548,"Amazing Food, Sunil is a great server love the atmosphere"
305548,Amazing food and service! Empress of china is our go to chinese restaurant. We love the food and impeccable service as usual. Special thanks to Mr Aman for servicing us so well and taking care of our dietery restrictions.
18336192,Small place tucked in the Epicuria food mall- with quick service. Food quality decent. A little overpriced. Staff is very efficient and helpful.
18336192,"Delicious! Service with a smile. Malaysian laksa vegetarian soup had more than a healthy portion of vegetables, which is a rare sight. The prawn tempura sushi roll was a treat. The rice was sticky and sweet. An additional garlic based sauce packed a punch. Sauteed sole was huge portion and cooked to perfection. Value for money."
18336192,"Amazing food and really good service. If one loves Asian and Thai cuisines, this is the place !! And one can enjoy food with friends at their rooftop seating area.  Food : 4/5 Location : 3/5 Service : 4/5 Ambience : 3.5/5"
18336192,"Best Asian food I have ever tried!! Brilliant food, lovely ambiance and great service. I went with my 3 friends, we have ordered 6 items which includes Khao suey noodles soup, prawn dumpling, chilli chicken as starters, and for main course black bean chicken, chicken khung pao, Hakka noodles and chili garlic fried rice. I tell you guys each dish tastes so good that you cannot compare each other. Also ordered 2 Coke. Good quantity food, only thing dumpling should be increased in quantity from 4 pieces to at least 6. Total amount around 4000 approx.  Average price for two : 2000 without alcohol. Recommended dish Khao suey noodles Soup in coconut milk (Thai cuisine). Next time I will visit and try some prawn dish for sure."
18336192,"The dimsums are over priced..300 plus taxes for 4 dimsums is quite high...should have atleast 6 dimsums in a basket. Also, they have discontinued with the combo dimsum baskets. Green thai curry was bland and just about average. Prawn penang dimsums were excellent..a must have."
18268390,Amazing place to hangout with your friends. It's great for all the lovers of drunk DJ Night. It is also one of the most expensive in New Delhi.
18268390,The best place to hang around and have some booze .lovely ambience and the dj will never disappoint you with his music . SPL thanks to the manager who's always there for the assistance .
18268390,Great place for people like me who called themselves party lovers. Budweiser was the only beer available that day so it was a drawback..so ultimately its a nice place
18268390,Ambiance was good ! Dj was also good ! They don't upload all the pictures !  sometimes you will feel you are at the right place but suddenly you will change your mind ! But the staff was amazing üòÅ
18268390,"Went there on Delta heavy night and it was super amazing ... Duo has been my all-time favorite as I'm listening them from past 10 years.. it's good place with good vibe all around... you should must try their cocktails ,fish and chilli chicken coming to sitting they got wide areas behind for sitting and sound is amazing however I found light bit tacky.... So there were 2 DJ's before Deltaheavy....The 2nd DJ was good and had good sense of music but the very first DJ was totally an ARSE..impatient and stupid .. he played bangers in his opening set what a stupid .. Thank god Delta Heavy didn't sue or screw him..though they must have thought what an A hole"
304917,"Nice and famous outlet, it is always buzzing with people. I often order lunch from the place. Chola Bhatura and Veg Biryani are very good (Biryani comes in a big earthen pot even on delivery 10/10 for presentation) Delux Thaali is also one of my most ordered item from the place"
304917,"Previous amritsari thali was the better one.this time amritsari thali spoil our mood ,worst experience ever with sona ."
304917,Thali is amazing . Good material . Nice place
304917,The thali is amazing. A great place for family dinner and also a good place for #vegan people.
304917,A bit crowded but nice place to visit and the paneer platter is amazing
18261188,"in last 3-4 years there have been flooding of chai cafes who offers english teas but noone can beat thadi wali cutting chai, eagerly waiting for thadis to open."
18261188,The prices have gone up and the food taste and chai has gone for a toss. Not Happy with chaayos experience anymore.
18261188,"Chayyos epicuria is a small place with good ambience. The service is good and the chai amazing. I usually go for meri wali chai and always find it made the way I want to be, with nothing more and nothing less."

2232,"Superb dinein experience at Pind Balluchi Nehru Place. Happy hours discount is awesome here. We were looking for some good restaurants cum bar and one of my friend suggested this. We ordered some drinks a d got 1+1 happy hour offer on this, other dishes are chicken tikka, chicken rara butter roties, biryani and we alls loved the taste. I specially love to mention service which is top class. Staff is very polite and cooperative. will love to visit again soon"
2232,"Good food and good service.Loved the ambience ,very courteous staff and very friendly.food was awesome. Would love to visit again .. specially Soya Chap"
304915,"Karim's is one of the best mughal restaurants serving mouth watering Mutton Rohan Josh. Had gone to Karim's for dinner. Ordered Mutton Rogan Josh, mutton was good and properly cooked. The service was good. Staff is polite and courteous."
304915,"Mutton korma was mouth watering and filling, authentic taste of mutton. Must go."
304915,"Karim's is a well known name from Delhi 6 which has got many outlets across Delhi. I visited the outlet located in Epicuria mall, Nehru Place. Their menu is filled with chicken and mutton delicacies.  I ordered a mutton Korma and naan. The order was served in 15 minutes. The food tasted amazing.  Korma was perfectly spiced and  the mutton pieces were well cooked. Naan looked more like khameeri roti but was toothsome.  Karim's never fails to amaze me.  Recommended!!"
304915,"This is best place to have Biryanis, Kebabs, Tikkas and rolls. I was longing to have mutton seekh for a very long time . Ordered Karim's Roll which is basically mutton seekh roll. It was lip smacking...the flavors were on point. This place never disappoints me."
148,I ordered a sub with sprite the've sent me mirinda and also they sent me lays instead of cheese cornitos never gonna order from them .
148,If you are going for healthy food. Must go there
148,"This is my go to place for healthy and delicious subs and sandwiches. Love their chicken tikka sub, must try"
148,"I had ordered for my beverages along with my food Only food came and no beverage. When i called them, they said write a complaint. You‚Äôd get a refund and then order again. No empathy towards the customers."
309738,"Every now and then we crave for Chinese food, so we had double paneer and manchurian combo. But unfortunately we were disappointed with the food. We have been to Yo china! located in faridabad as well which never disappointed us."
309738,It is the best place for all the Chinese lovers. Veg manchurian sizzler is a must try.  Honey chilli potatoes and veg Hakka noodles are taste bud satisfying.   Yo China is a budget friendly restaurant.  So you could go as many times with your friends. Service and staff are good  Food-4.5/5 Service 4.5/5
309738,"Very good food, tried their sizzlers and chilli dry fish and prawns with some rice..it was a very good experience, they just need to lower their prices a bit on some dishes!"
309738,I ordered Chilli Paneer Sizzler which was served hot and tasted really good. Noodles were perfect in taste with hot garlic sauce. One should must try it.
309738,"Worst food of the century at Yo China epicuria Mall can't be consumed by the human beings unlimited Chilly in the food, worst food worst restaurant Yo China epicuria Mall, wastage of money and so expensive useless food"
308331,A lovely cheeze burst Paneer pizza with a lovely crust and amazing toppings it's a bit over priced when compared to other pizza chains but trust me when I say this the taste is worth every penny spent I am in love with the pizzas at pizza hut I would really recommend you try and compare for yourself and find out how right I was hehe But I will definately recommend pizza hut over any other pizza chain. Period
308331,Pizzzzzzzzzaaaaaaaaaa Hut Very gooooood tandorri smokey taste üòçüî•  Their tandoori paneer pizza is litüî•
308331,Not good
308331,White sauce was something at last thing qtgat would I would like to eat
3607,"This shop is located in the Satyam complex on the side from where you enter the main walking area of Nehru place Market. It's a small outlet with no seating. A few people can stand and eat, though. The cleanliness levels are not bad, but not super clean. The value for money they offer is great.  I got a Malabar Parantha and veg korma packed from here yesterday. The Malabar Parantha is excellent, but the veg korma given with it was mainly soyabean based, and a little bland to my liking. Since it's a chain, it appeared to me that the Parantha was prepared there itself, whereas the korma was prepacked."
3607,May not meet the exact taste-bud you may be having on mind and tongue.. but worth the prices.. ordered rava-dosa and sambhar few days back.. sambhar was good but rava-dosa didn't match the class and taste of other south-indian outlets. Nevermind. Good to go.
3607,"Southy is good option if you are looking for south indian food. Visited this outlet first time.¬† Had butter masala dosa which was good in taste, ambience was average, service can also be better ."
3607,Had the one of the better snacks thali for 215. It had food for 2 small stomach people. The place does not have ac but but if they weather is good then you can enjoy out in the market. Try the snacks thali you will not regret it
3607,"Great South Indian food. They have many outlets in delhi NCR.¬†The¬†food is tasty, authentic and very economic. The packaging of the food was well.  Ordered the following:¬†  Lemon Rice: Was very tasty and very light on pocket. The quantity¬†was also good. ¬†  Paneer dosa: Tasted good. The paneer stuffing was cooked very nicely¬†and was served with Samber, coconut chetney and tomato Chetney. Samber was good in taste.  Additionally they had included a plain papad in the order which was very fresh and crispy.  *** Follow me Instagram/FB - fithungrytraveller and on Snapchat - snap_fht ***"
5487,"Ordered for famous Paneer Rice and shahi kofta but was Utterly SHOCKED AT WHAT I got as the RICE ITSELF WAS PLAIN BOILED RICE AND NOT THE USUAL PULAV THAT U GET TO BEGIN WITH. NEXT, THE PANEER AND KOFTA GRAVY WERE THE SAME WITH A LITTLE PIECE OF PANEER AND A TINY BALL OF KOFTA SWIMMING IN ORANGE GRAVY, TASTING AS TOMATO SAUCE......WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE TASTE AND QUALITY, FEEL DISSAPOINTED AND CHEATED."
1185,Pathetic place. Pathetic review about this place.  Pathetic condition. Pathetic feedback pathetic review pathetic performance pathetic pay pathetic pathetic
1185,"Tried this place out with a group of friends but the overall experience wasnt too good.  The food quality was ok but the portions were too less for the price. 3/5  Service was simply pathetic.People there had no idea on what drinks to serve under discount or package and their behavior also wasn't too appreciable. 1/5  The ambiance was overall decent as there was not much of a crowd. 3/5  Because of the bad experience,would never go to this place"
1185,The three-course meal was a good buy! The salad in the starters though can be altered as it was just lots of cabbages with mayo which wasn't so something I relished. Quiet place! Good music and ambience!
1185,"There was a huge rodent in the restaurant. If this is the state of affairs where customers sit, I can only imagine what the kitchen is like. That's not the kind of food anyone would want to eat."
1185,The 2.5 rating is only because the drinks were good. This place used to be actually good. However lately the food quality has gone down. The nachos we ordered were burnt n flavourless. Main course also was not up to the mark. It'll take a lot of improvement before I visit again.
304913,"Whenever you want to have indian , you can get the food delivered from moti mahal... good taste and lovely to relish dal makhni with naan."
304913,"Aweful... ordered deluxe thali. Food appearance and taste old unfresh .,.. aweful taste...white dal makhni...mix veg frozen...was it really moti"
304913,Its the best place to have Desi Indian food. The weather was so good that day that I decided to have Indian cuisine. Spicy food was the perfect company for a rainy weather.   Must try-  Kadhai Chicken  Chicken Lababdaar  Garlic Naan  Meal Combos/ Thalis  Tandoori platters are way too good!!
304913,Went to this place with lot of expectations. We order a Non veg Thali. Though the butter chicken was very good but the taste of dal was not satisfying. Also the quantity of dal is very less. Otherwise other things were fine. I hope to have a better experience next time
304906,Food and portions not at all at par with the quantity you guys serve. Really need to work on this to improve. Sad quantity levels!
304906,"The four cheese pizza I ordered had nothing put cheese spread, the charged me for trash food."
304906,Atrocious is the only word for them. Order at ypur own risk.
18126080,Amazing dosas and south Indian fare. The rawa masala Dosa is perfectly well prepared and the accompaniments are traditional too! The service is smooth and hassle free.
18126080,"This place is a paradise for veggie lovers  Great south india food They also have a big range of North Indian food  All the food tastes good  My order in detail  1. Paper plain Dosa- served with Sambher and 3 chutney, the paper plain Dosa is very crisp and yum , I prefer plain one , if you like masala to go for then my advice will be to take it separately as the crisp of the Dosa last till your last bite 3. Butter masala Dosa : very tasty again served with sambher and chutney the butter masala Dosa is good in taste but I feel it to be bit oily this can be personal too but the person who accompanied me cherished it thoroughly  Overall the place is very good a must try"
18126080,"Shree Rathnam is quite an old name in this industry, famous for it's delicious South Indian variety. Being a vegetarian, I prefer those restaurants which are purely vegetarian. Voila, Shree Rathnam is pure vegetarian !! üòç  Though Shree Rathnam is famous for delicious South Indian cuisine but recently tried hands on their Chinese variety of dishes. Tried Chilly paneer dry, hakka noodles & veg Hot n Sour soup. All of them were pretty good. Chilly paneer dry was the best.   Overall a good restaurant for small gatherings & maybe family outings. Dillikepakwan recommends this."
18126080,Yay or Nay - Yay  Pocket-Friendly - Yes  After roaming around in the nehru place market.. We got hungry and so decided to munch on something. This is a good place to try out South Indian food but we decided to have pani puri and some chaat. The chat was good but pani puri wasn't that good. It's difficult to find the best pani puri in Delhi I guess.
18126080,"It, is a place where you can get the wide range of food,from the north Indian to South Indian and the,Chinese as well !!! This place is perfect for the family,although, I feel that they are loosing their authentication when It comes to the South Indian food.  Overall the food is OK  Service Is OK"
3608,Best and cheesy pizza
3608,"Always a pleasure to have my favourite pizza from this place and they totally deserve applause. Ordered my favourite pizza, i.e. onion, corn flavours and they delivered it on time. Though the oder is big as per quantity but still it's on time and totally fresh. Really love the service and ofcourse pizza. Recommendations - 8/10"
3608,As always value for money and the best
3608,I really love the ambience & i also love cheese brust  pizza  & the staff were aswome i really love it
306031,Yesterday  ordered
306031,The sauces I had mentioned were not there in my sub...instead only mayo was put in it.
306031,Food was cold and it was delivered after 61mins after ordering we did not enjoy#subwaybesubway
306031,"This outlet of subway is located in the epicuria mall food court in the basement of the mall. The staff here is friendly and courteous. They do not fuss about putting extra sauces as some of the other subway outlets do. Every time I have had a sub here the veggies and the bread are super fresh. I don't prefer the processed meats from subway so mostly order the veggie delight sub or salad with loads of sauces. Also, one can never resist the double chocolate chip cookies which are a must have.  ¬†(hint: ask them to give the cookie warm and thank me later)"
7720,I had ordered Chicken Biryani last week and it was delicious. Quality of food is amazing at the best price offered by this outlet. Must try..
18337892,Ambience is great..!!! And food too is good.. Would suggest people to visit here.. Whole menu is superb.. Very convenient to travel and its just reasonable at cost..
18337892,"Nice and delicious food and price are budget friendly want to recommend others , quantity is also good with very hygiene quality of food !!!!"
18337892,"Amazing interior, the service is really good. A good place for dinner. The taste of food is amazing. Variety of delicacies. Staff service is also nice"
18337892,Great ambience! Lovely food!  Highly recommended!  Chicken tikka roll was quite subtle in taste. Bhuna degi gosht is the go to dish.  Right opposite metro station.
18337892,"Food and services were very good , Nonveg plater are very delacious, Restaurant is also very neat and clean it's best place for family in Abul Fazal."
602,"Not a very nice experience. I had ordered a chicken sandwich and tea.The staff was busy on their mobile phones. While the sandwich was ready and getting cold, there was noone available to make the tea and serve the order. When I questioned the delay is when they started to work on the order. There should be some sort of quality control in place."
602,"The worst place I have ever been to! I am a coffee fan!! You guys simply ruined my coffee today. I guess the worst CCD I hv ever been to would be this. Staff doesn't know anything. Doesn't convey the right message. Coffee tasted pathetic, don't know whether their machine was not running properly or the beans used were not of good quality. I can simply tell by smelling of my coffee is.and this was simple a milk shake. Never coming back to you guys. And yes we ordered a paneer sandwich with cheese ( which the lady on counter upselled saying- aapka sandwich nahi toh bahut Sukha Sukha hoga) and when the order came , there was no cheese in it! Where all you guys go wrong!"
602,Exploring munchy treatment from ccd with their new cold combo of mighty muncher which has an option of cold cafe frappe and a classic sandwich in which i opt for corn n cheese sandwich. Ambience of the place is nice and you have an comfort level while sitting there.Food is quite fresh and they have well mannered staff. Fruitylicious fiesta is the new addition to their menu which includes drinks with fruit of the season so go out n try that too.
1401,Sweet tooth person will go there.
1401,This is the only pure vegetarian outlet located in community centre of NFC. The paneer dishes here are very good especially the paneer pasanda. Thalis are better option if looking for a complete lunch. Overall the prices are reasonable and a good option for students.
1401,I had one of the worst experience of my life dining in this restaurant. The food quality is pathetic and the staff isn‚Äôt polite as well#aggrawalbhenkalola
1401,Have tried a few veg meals and old delhi style faluda kulfi  Meals were average one ; so does the faluda kulfi.   You normally gets better kulfi in delhi; here it was too sweet; faludas were not the refreshing and kulfi was a bit hard
1401,"Tried Papdi Chat and Aloo tikki, both were good. It is located next to Al Bake and hence you can locate it easily. If you are looking for proper dining then it is not a place, more of a street food and quick eat. Chat is a must try."
311553,Best dish is chaska roll and tandoori momos. Delivery option is not good. Overall fantastic one of the best halal restaurant in Delhi in Okhla area
311553,worst restaurant ever. I have ordered 2 times from here. first time they sent wrong order and second time i have ordered 2 chow mein and we received only one. we didn't ordered from zomato for this but i am using this platform to aware you all of you please dont order anything from here.
2585,Food taste good ambience is not too well got for takeaway or delivery at reasonable price with good quantity space is less cam go there if group is small
2585,"One of my favorite places in new friends colony... Seriously, I highly recommend this place..They Served best mutton masala, chicken dahiya and butter chicken.. Highly recommended!!!"
4101,City‚Äôs amazing freshly baked breads at an amazing discounted prices.. great quality and a must try thing..
4101,"Belongs to a five star hotel, hence has the benefit of serving quality food. Food is good, ambience is good, staff is good, however there is only one at a time. So I had ordered a cake and he had gone to pick it up from the kitchen, during that time there were 2 guests waiting and none to attend. This entire activity took some 20 mins to pick up a pre ordered üç∞."
4101,"According to me French Crust is among top 3 bakery's in Delhi. I am eating their cakes since my Childhood. ¬†But at the same time i want to share my bitter experience also with French Crust. I ordered a fancy cake 10 days in advance obviously for a very very important occasion. When i ordered the cake the person took the order didn't say that it would come out to be different and when i got the cake it was nowhere close to what i had asked for. So i canceled my order of which i had paid in advance 100 percent, i was promised that i would get voucher of similar amount to use in future in Suryaa Hotel's eaterys' but i haven't got anything yet. Check out the photographs which would explain what i wanted and what i got. But still i would say as long it is the matter of taste then according to me French Crust is among few best in Delhi NCR, believe me i have already tried most of 5 star hotel's bakery's the only message is that don't go for cosmetic cakes. I had ordered another normal cake which Chef recommended me and that was Brownie cake and i must say that the Chef recommended me the right cake and everyone enjoyed that in my family."
709,"Baskin and Robbins have a small and compact outlet at the NFC market. There is not much things to say about ice creams when it comes to Baskin and Robbins, they craft really delicious and very yummy ice creams. Went for trying a unique flavor of ice cream which is Mint white chocolate chip & to my surprise it was so yummy. It has adequate place for sitting , but you can find a lot of benches outside the outlet. Overall a good experience.  Taste: 5/5  Service: 4/5  VFM: 4/5"
709,This is my favorite flavor of all time. I love brownies but usually prefer vanilla over chocolate ice cream because I do not like things that are too sweet. But this flavor is just amazing. Love the brownie.
709,I love to visit this place! It's been a while i visited here... But i remember the blueberry cheesecake ice cream! Its was just mouth watering with. Really a very nice taste!
709,Best place for ice cream lovers to visit give it a try on virgin chocolate and dark chocolate and ret of all ice creams are highly creamy. And chocoblock was also amazing.
7721,"A great place for tasty food . I ordered Butter chicken from them on numerous occasions and have loved it . Chicken tikka,Malai tikka and other Mughlai items have been awesome."
7721,"Being tired and very lazy, ordered tandoori chicken, butter chicken, roomali roti and dal makhani from this place. But i was left totally dissapointed by what was delivered.  The tandoori chicken was half cooked and chewy. The dal tasted stale and old, nothing sort of what you would expect from such a big brand. The butter chicken had a funny taste and the chicken was again chewy and dry. The only saving grace was the roomali roti, which i know for the fact are not made in house.  This franchise business have done nothing but bring down the name of such big legends."
7721,"Best butter chicken in New Friends Colony to order home. Must try it once, the butter chicken is extremely fresh and the gravy makes one binge."
7721,Amazing place for home delivery. Love their butter chicken & chicken tikka masala with romaali roti. Definitely for a quick bite‚ù§Ô∏è. A place I'll have from again!
7721,"I completely love food. Especially their dum aloo, Virgin Mojito. Service was good. Friendly staff. Quite expensive but according food its worth it. But do check the bill, and request Them to remove service charge."
3337,This is one of the best place to enjoy food. Extremely delicious and hygienic food.  Staff is well behaved and courteous...
3337,"Awesome veg food, loved karai paneer. Quality of roti is awesome, very soft roti and paranthas ... will order again soon"
3337,"This old fashioned restaurant was visited by me in the hope that it‚Äôs food would be great. However, when I ordered mutton curry and butter chicken, I wasn‚Äôt happy with cooking. The gravy in both were too thick and hardly tasty. To top it, the plain rotis were slightly burnt in the tandoor and gave a bitter after taste because of the carbon.  Om hotel is no more what it used to be earlier."
302742,"Left out 1 star just because of the prices. They're a bit high. But, the quality, the taste, the ambience... it's spot on! Really enjoy going here on a Saturday night. One must try their Dal Khatir, Mutton Kakori, Gravy, Veg Galouti and Phirni"
302742,"Extremely soft and mouthwatering kebabs, and extremely polite staff"
302742,"Craving kebabs? Wait no more and head to Sab Ke Khatir for the best kebabs in town. This place serves the most authentic and organic kebabs with all the preparations done in-house. I bet they serve the best chicken tikka in town. Must have: Kakori Kebab, Ghalauti Kebab, Gilafi Kebab  Location: 100m away from Lodhi Hotel."
302742,Piping hot biryani to soothe your midnight cravings. Chicken Biryani served with perfect balance of spices.
302742,Sab ki khatir is a place where you can go and have endless and you will have a bill of very less amount. It is so yummy and affordable. I love it
300744,Too good Chicken Curry accompanied with Butter Nan. Delivery done in Lajpat Nagar within 30 mins and food was delivered hot and nicely packed. Taste was amazing with mild spicy.
300744,Stupid butter chicken stupid gravy stupid onion... I don't know they saving cream for there
300744,The chaap was sooo spicy that it was impossible to eat it. Despite loving spicy food..it was inedible even for me. I could barely eat it!
300744,Delivery from Chawlas never disappoints. My all time favourite is Butter Chicken in mains and chicken chops in appetizers. Quick service with amazing taste.
300744,You must try afghani chicken from this outlet.  Balanced creamy and nicely grilled. Good quantity of food in full plate...staff behaviour is good..nice and clean place..
3339,Gravy king. But the tawa items are not upto to the mark. Taste is amazing and chicken is well cooked. Rolls are really nice with prantha as well as roomali.
3339,"Today i ordered paneer tikka; rumali roti, and chicken....its too yummy and spicy...delivery was to fast...packing was neat and clean...i like all the food iteams"
3339,when they opened they were really good sadly over a period of time they have lost the touch to make tasty food .butter chicken and the mutton curry is what i order ...rotis become like bricks till they reach home .overall average
18369763,There's nothing much that we could do than binging on some lovely pizza's this quarantine season. Was fortunate to order from here and enjoy some of the most delicious cheesy pizzas. The packaging was good and I really liked binging my pizza along with chocolate shake
18369763,"I ordered from instapizza..  I really liked the food  The presentation was fabulous..   I've ordered for veggie Deluxe pizza and paneer pizza..  This outlet is just amazing. And serves great food..  Pizza had a fresh base.   Overall , I'm simply their fan..   5/5 for food   Totally worth it"
18369763,"My favourites from the Instapizza's menu are tandoori paneer special, chicken tikka special, amercian bomb non veg and the Italian Stallion. Other than the pizzas, the sides on their menu are awesome : especially the cheese chicken pcokt and cheesy dip dip garlic strips. The service is fantastic. Food, I was left speechless. There were reallllly tasty. Guys, go ahead - don't give it a miss!"
18369763,"The healthy pizzas by Instapizza are scrumptious. The crust is thin and the pizza is loaded with toppings. I have tried the Classic American Pepperoni pizza, BURRAAH chicken makhani, mac and cheese poppers and peri peri potato wedges. The wedges were crispy and the poppers had a lot of cheese "
18369763,"Insta pizza has some wonderful and tasty pizzas. The order delivers as soon as possible. The cooking time is quiet less, the food has an amazing fragrance and it delivered hot. We ordered Cheesy Margarita, chicken bomb pizza and cheesy dip dip garlic sticks. the food quantity is impressive and taste wise, it is mindblowing!"
307785,Quality is good but not that great.....as it becomes a brand now....so even they are also not much bother about this.
307785,"Ordered paneer tikka got all veggies,in one paneer tikka no paneer in other one"
307785,the person named waris he us a very good person  very friendly person he is good guy
307785,Ordered paneer tikka sub and received veggie delight instead. Slow and late service. Most importantly even ZOMATO help service don‚Äôt help. They don‚Äôt reply and basically they both cheated.
9573,I am loving it
9573,This place needs no introduction.  This place brings back the childhood memories ‚ù§Ô∏è  Their menu is super affordable üëå  All time favourite place üòç
9573,Kshitiz
9573,McDonald‚Äôs is our favourite place. Their McAloo Tikka Meal is what we order every time we visit. Really yummy.
302514,"This is a really good place to have most of Delhi's street style food, all at one placeüëå  Kadimi has amazing Indian breakfast options, including bedmi, kachori, Puri with chhole & sabzi.  This place serves, JAIN FOOD ONLY, so for all the people who don't prefer onion & garlic.  This is a local favourite among people residing in Bhogal, Jungpura, Nizamuddin, Ashram etc.  Apart from snacks, this place also serves North Indian lunch & dinner options, Chinese food & Sweets.  All of it is amazing üòç"
302514,This place has variety of dish from street food to starter to main course. I was looking for some evening snacks so visited this place. Had bread pakora and jalebi which was worth of money.

308628,The cheesecakes are a delight!
308628,JUST AN AMAZING MEAL. FIVE STAR AT HOME!!! Had sole fish in creamy mustard sauce combo!!absolutely brilliant and perfect for one person with vegetables and bread too. WOW
308628,Received Orange Peel's chocolate walnut brownies as a Diwali gift and I must say that they are absolutely delicious. Very rich and yet light melt in your mouth. Loved them.
308628,The best brownies I have ever had in my life! Rich flavor and texture! Brownies that melt in your mouth! Thank you for baking us such amazing brownies! (an MDI student)
308628,My go to place for fancy cakes. They did my parents 25th anniversary cake. It was one of the best cakes I've tasted my entire life. I hate fondant but the fondant they used was thin and didn't taste fake. It was a chocolate mud cake flavored cake. Amazing flavors! The fondant work on TOP! Everyone loved it. There wasn't enough cake for the people as we ordered keeping in mind that there will be other desserts too but the other desserts were left untouched until the cake got over. Only if I had ordered a bigger size.  Have also tried her pies and other cakes. Superb in all ways!
3684,"I am ice cream lover many times I ordered ice cream from them due to lover prices ice cream are tasty but they add coconut etc with some flavour which not goes well with flavour such as vanilla but Some flavors are really good like chocolate, strewberry etc. Must try their tubs"
3684,"I have heard lot about this restaurant. But when i took a first sip, the milk was expired and the owner was not willing to accept the same. Despite his servant admitted the same .  Thereafter, people gathered and i learnt that this restaurant has depleted its quality and thats why not able to fetch customers now. Poor quality."
3684,"Pal refreshment corner is well placed in Jangpura near to Barbeque nation area..  We visited jangpura with some work and missed our lunch and by the time we were free we checked quick food.. So we landed to Pal refreshment corner..  We had ordered below items, do not kbiw what went wrong we entered after reading all the reviews and experience was not satisfactory..  Veg Spring roll-it was too oily and when we complained they changed and next time served ok  Veg fried rice-Although we were full hungroo still we could not had veg fried rice and chilli paneer and left the food as there is no taste in it..  Chilly paneer--Not sure chilli paneer had no taste and we co plaint for this as well but chef cameand told i use to cook the same way.. But later, we agreed leave as it is and we had left the plate..  Chicken fried rice-Tgis was good in proportion and taste and we had this and finished the bowl.  Later, we told all this incident to the owner and initially he assured us that same chef is preparing for everyone no complaint whatso ever, but when we told sir we were full hungry and still could not able to finish so you just think.. so atlast he charged few rupees less in the bill..  Thank you!! Sir..  Not sure that was just a bad day or so.. But had ok ok experience..  All the best Team!!  Regards, CSD"

312949,I love Janta bakery's Red Velvet cake. This is so delicious that melts in my mouth so quickly. Pineapple pastry was also good. But nothing can't beat the taste and smoothness of Red Velvet cake.  Next time will try their choco chips cake as well. Love you Janta Bakery :)

18463963,"Always on a lookout for healthy reasonable food delivery options and tonight I stumbled upon Transform Nutrition. The menu reads decently and I ordered myself a Rose Caribbean chicken meal with brown rice. I was expecting it to be good cuz the description was so. Coming down to the taste test, I was disappointed very much. The quantity is super poor. For a 265 bucks, I recieved barely any food, legit half of what it should be and the flavors were just not right. There was nothing Carribean about the chicken, the tomato gravy was well cooked but seasoned with oregano??!! Adding to that was the level of spice there, not good either.  Overall I was disappointed. Expected better."
18463963,"Ref to the description provided on swiggy. The wheat pasta contained only capsicum as against the broccoli, beans, mushrooms, olives, basil mentioned in the online ordering menu. Very disappointed with the taste and experience. Never ordering again. ü§Æ"
18463963,The menu the food is good but I think this restaurant they don't give a damn about the customers I ordered twice by Zomato and I called up the valet after 40 mins to get the update as it said delivery time 37 mins he said sir they have gone to take the item it was out of stock they shouldn't have taken the order in the first place if they don't have and this same situyhas happened before also when I get a call from Zomato with this same place.
18463963,Tried this place after a friends recommendation and had their chicken breast. It was moraccan chicken breast. Served hot and filling for one person. The taste was good and it had good flavors.

7874,"Visited this place and ordered food ( kabuli pulao,  kofta and chicken pulao). First packaging was very poor,  by the time it reached home food came out of boxes.  Secondly,  food was very bland moreover it had only one small piece of meat and few pieces of clean bones.  I won't recommend this place and not going back there."

7874,"Though I am a fan of mughlai, every once in a while I appreciate the subtle taste of spices from Afghanistan. I visited this place once. We had ordered their korma which was more soupy than the Indian version. It was light on the spices unlike what we usually eat. We had ordered mantu, the Afghani momos.. Served with dahi and chana dal soup on top. Though I wasn't very happy about the chana dal.. The sheer size of the mantu was very overwhelming.... Oh!! That was one huge mutton dumpling. And it was tasty! Their bread was very thick and chewy but went well with the korma. We also tried the biryani which was very mildly spiced with carrots and raisins. It was unusual and yummy.  The best was the kahwa which they served us.  Overall its a decent place to visit."
7874,"Not a great experience.Visited Kabul, today the way was torturous. The food Kabuli Pulao, Kofta and Chicken Pulao, i found to be too bland for my palate, though was aromatic. The curry of kofta was runny, and needs to be worked upon. I got the food packed, the packaging was not reliable, it is something which needs attention. Not sure whether, would visit again ...."
7889,"Food is good but the staff is shit.patties are recommended,stuffed bread dont really have any stuffing here.The staff talks rudly with customers."

7889,This is a small brakery in the market of jankpura and we ordered our one of the cake of new year from here. Cake was ok. Will recommend to people who are exploring this market

7879,i was ordering the mutton curry and jeera rice from this restaurant and its quite awesome the combination is very good mutton curry and jeera rice you should try this combination from this restaurant the one thing is not good in this restaurant is the early closing time. otherwise everything is good. thankyou
7879,"Nice place situated near Eros cinema. They don't have proper seating inside however they have put a few chairs and table outside where you can sit and eat.

303608,"I just love this restaurant. A number of times, not finding the time to cook, Simple Restaurant has been my Savior. I found it through Zomato and have been hooked ever since. Delectable Food, A huge Menu and quick service are what makes me keep on ordering from them. Compared to other restaurants in my area, they are very cheap, give a huge quantity of the food ordered sufficient for two people and they are quick to deliver. My personal favourites are the Special Thali, the Spring Rolls (Just the right amount of crispy and scrumptious), Paneer Bhurji with Paranthas and Sweet and Sour Vegetable. ¬†Both Non veg and Veg Varieties are good. They have both Indian and Chinese and both are good. I love their range of Paneer, Onion, Aloo Parathas as well which are value for money. Try them once, You will love them! I have been ordering from them since last two years and shall continue to do so in future."
303608,Considering the price this place serves the best food.Ideal for delivery and cheap food. The service is very quick so they will not keep you waiting for your food for long and serves hot.
18409180,I work for event organization. So odd hr in okhla is casual visit for me.  I have been there prior also. They follow Sol's. So don't find ny change in every store. All stores are similar.

7483,"I placed an order online nearly 2 weeks ago. The value of the order was close to Rs. 900 (prepaid). However, I am yet to receive this order and no one is picking up on the two numbers provided on their website. While I'm mindful that there may be delays due to lockdown, 2 weeks without any communication is not acceptable. They still appear to be accepting orders on their website without fulfilling earlier orders so think twice before you place an order with them."
7483,Cnt waste much time writing for them. To let all know posting thr pics their food is just not stale but full of fungus. Imagine how old is their stock and they dont even care about the same before dispatching. Do not try them if you dont want FOOD POISONING.

18289277,"I remember watching my grand maa cook the best meals in the kitchen or sometimes passing her best recipes to my mom which of course which learned from hers. I was 6 years old then and since then have seen my dadi and mom cook some of the best meals for us in the house. Cooking a meal is one of the most personal and intimate things you can do for someone. You're literally providing plated nourishment made with your own hands and creativity ‚Äî even if you're following a recipe, you picked the recipe and planned the meal, didn't you? 22 years since then and now one thing that hasn't change is with the love my mom still cooks for all of us in the family. The moment you sit down to share that meal with your loved ones, you realise there is one thing that bonds all of us together and that is home cooked food. And thanks to Cook Fresh for helping us repaying it back to our mom and our family. Even if you are not a professional cook, you still will love to cook with the Cook Fresh boxes. How well have they conceptualised the idea is brilliant in itself. You are given a recipe card along with the cut ingredients and that's how simple it is. No chopping, no sweating, no cutting and still producing a gourmet dish. ¬†  So you must be wondering how does Cook Fresh work. They basically deliver ready to cook meals at your doorstep, hygienically packed in exact quantities.   You will first have to choose a dish to order. They have 39 mind blowing recipes from Thai Green Papaya Salad to Chicken and Broccoli Stir Fry to Moist Chocolate Mug Cake to Spaghetti Bolognese. I can feel your mouth watering already. Anyways, once you are sure about the dish to order, you can add that to your cart. If you want your orders to be delivered the same day, you will have to place an order before 2 pm. You can for your order either pay online or there is an option of a COD too. Once that is done you are then handed over a box which is very neatly packed with the measured ingredients along with the recipes card. All of the ingredients are pre-portioned, chopped and labelled inside a biodegradable box, which is designed to keep the contents fresh. Once you are ready to cook, open the box and cook yourself a gourmet dish and be ready to surprise your loved ones. The special thing about a home cooked meal is the feeling of abundance it provides, everything you have and need is right in front of you and within arms' reach. That feeling of freedom is real, and you see it in the smiles of your guests after the meal begins. Bon App√©tit.  Citrus chicken Quinoa salad (Rs 389): Quinoa is well on its way to being dubbed super grain of the millennium. Quick-cooking quinoa is a nutritional powerhouse, packed with protein, iron, and fiber. It is also the foundation for a main-course salad. I am absolutely in love with this and for sure ordering this whenever I am in a mood to order a heart and healthy salad.  Greek Salad (Rs 339): Made with pieces of tomatoes, sliced cucumbers, onion, feta cheese, and olives, typically seasoned with salt and oregano, and dressed with olive oil. This is exactly what you are looking for to beat this summer heat. This tart and crispy salad complements a variety of entrees, from casseroles and meats to pasta and pizza.  Spaghetti Bolognese (Rs 389): My mom is still praising me for this in front of my relatives :-p. From fusillini to Gnocchi to Farfalle, pasta comes in different shapes and sizes but my favourite has always been spaghetti. I love the way one slurps it down the throat. A classic Bolognese sauce tastes great, no matter how simple. Once that depth of flavour start coming in the sauce is sure to be one of family's favourite.   Chicken Pad Thai (Rs 389): What happens when fish sauce, soy sauce, tamarind paste, beans sprouts, ginger, garlic comes in contact with each other, magic happens. Pad Thai is one of my favourite dish that I can have anytime of the day, anywhere in the world. Made from stir fried rice noodles with ingredients including egg, peanuts, onions and chicken. Mastering an easy recipe for pad Thai with chicken at home is the best culinary discovery that has happened to me. Special thanks to Cook Fresh for this.  Goan Paneer (Rs 299): One thing about Cook Fresh is that it gives you the freedom to experiment your kitchen. Goan style Paneer is a simple and tasty variation from the regular Punjabi style paneer dishes. Funny, when I first saw the recipe card with coconut milk in it because that has never been a part of our curries. The cuisine is highly influenced by the Hindu origin, but has high impact from the Portuguese with their colonization for about 400 hundred years. Spicy on the palate you will enumerate this dish into your kitchen today.  So what are you waiting for, Cook gourmet, healthy meals like a professional chef at home with Cook Fresh!  Happy eating :)"

306739,"Ankit Fast Food Corner  - A small outlet on the Palam Dabri Road which was started by a lad named Ishwar. The guy started out by serving just Omelettes and Boiled eggs on a cart, but years of determination and hard work later he was able to transform his cart into a shop. The quality that he used to provide in the Omelettes was quite appreciable and made him a household name over time throughout the Palam Area as Bahadur Ande Wala.   Seeing the market trends, he has adapted with time and has now started serving all sorts of chinese food as well alongwith his claim to fame, the Omelettes and the boiled eggs. And these introductions have been quite well received as well as you will not found the shop empty at any time in the evening. One can see quite a healthy number of regulars here in the evening indicating his loyal base.  I've been here countless number of times for his famous Omelettes and the boiled eggs but have recently acquired tasted for their Chili Potato as well, which are crispy and flavorful and the prices are not pocket sucking either. The owner is quite a nice guy and the staff is very helpful too.  Overall a must visit place."

And after witnessing resounding success with their Samosas, they have now started offering other items like Spring Rolls, Bread Pakodas etc as well.¬†  The outlet being just in front of the Railway Station addresses hundreds of passengers daily and because of their ever-increasing sale they have converted this small old fashioned shop into a New modular one. Barring few tables placed outside, the outlet has not much space to offer as the inner part of the shop is used entirely by the staff indulged in the preparation of the snacks due to which most people prefer the take away option.  Been there a number of times and have tried their Aloo, Chowmein, Macroni and Meetha Samosa, each and every one has a great and unique taste to it. The size of samosas is big as compared to what you get from the other shops and thus is quite filling. Prices are nominal too.  Overall a heaven for samosa lovers."
312146,"Janta Lassi - An outlet in Palam which has been serving Lassi for almost a decade now.  The shop is in front of the Railway Station and offers Lassi, Paneer and other normal dairy products.

Been there a number of times. Initially the price of Lassi ranged from 10-15-20 rupees but ever since the shop got renovated, the owner have tripled up the prices and are now offering it at 30-45-60 rupees per glass. The Lassi comprises of a scoop of butter and some secret liquid stuff which lends to it an amazing flavor. The quantity is also good, so much so that if you drink a Medium/Large Glass of their Lassi, there will be no place left in your stomach to have anything else.   Overall a must try for Lassi lovers."

Only thing I sometimes find that needs to be fixed is: at times the chicken pieces lack that juiciness and seem to be a lil dry, but yeahh either ways the taste is very very amazing, it'll Will never disappoint you.  overall it‚Äôs a treat to the taste buds, am sure if you eat from here once you'll be a regular coustmer, yes it's addicive af. This is where you finally fall for the line that yes food is my drug! And am addicted. It's a must try if you happen to be around this place‚ô•"
18431159,"The best Biryani, i have ever had in this area. Nice texture, tempting smell and great taste.  The only thing i didn't liked or i would say the only thing which is lacking is the juiciness of the chicken. They can do more better by improving the taste pf the chicken in there.  Overall, i can recommend this hotel to the folks live around there.   Have a great brunch!!!"
18431159,Best taste.value for money..good pieces of chicken..try  Chicken changezi ..its  awesome....roomali roti is not so good but quite ok.will try other foods too
306733,Aggerwal sweets feel that it is made of pure desi ghee and the quality is quite good and as we all know that desi ghee is good for our health and bread pakora pani puri is too good
301783,Has wide variety of sweets with authentic taste and flavor. The samosas are very tasty filled with spicy aloo filling. They also serve noodles and spring rolls
18489651,We had a order chicken manchurian and roti really it was amazing food and we are happy with the night rider and fast delivery... I really strongly recommend.. Taste his food...   Sumit Singh  Dwarka
18489651,"Simply awsome food. I ordered chicken biriyani and daal makhni with lachcha parantha, and all of tjese were great in taste. I ll recommend them to my all frnd and relatives."
18489651,Best Takeaway I ever had. The y are fast and taste is too good . Kadhai chicken and kadhai paneer was awesome. Keep it up and maintain the taste like that.
18489651,"Just amazing, I order Kadhai Chicken and naan from the night riders and they made it on time and food was too good. Just loved it. Hope they will stay tasty and we will order lifelong..."
301775,Very poor
301775,My experience at Da Pizza Hub was great. The food quality and quantity was not at all compromised and the taste was perfect! Also the service was very quick and efficient!  Please order only Kailash puri chowk branch it's was awesome taste
301775,"I ordered pizza combo today.. but what I received is 2 pizzas stuffed in a single box smudged together.. the base on 1 pizza was burnt and other was uncooked.. disheartening experience.. I have ordered a several times from this outlet but this time it was a nightmare.. and they decreased the size to 6"" instead of 7""."
301775,Very very POOR TASTE AND POOR QUALITY. I ordered cheese garlic bread and masala fries form them and what i got was a bun cut into half and topped with some fake or unhealthy cheese and the worst fries i have ever eaten...fries were full or oil and totally tasteless. Extremely poor quality and very late service. Please please do not order from this place.üëéüëéüëéüëé
301775,Catering was awesome nicky managed all things Services soo good Friendly staff Quality awesome  Its a family reasturant awesome offers good area for party
306750,My every Sunday evening snack spot. They serve really tasty kathi rolls. Rolls are crispy and filled with sauces. A must try place Highly recommended by me
306750,This outlet serves the best Kathi rolls in all over palam. They need to work more on Chinese but Kathi rolls are the best. Keep it up guys.  Perfect
313012,"A good and lovely place specially Pizza, one time try also if u want a lovely taste of pizza, pocket friendly also but disappointed on delivery of beverages only"
313012,"I was feeling lazy after housework, so I decided to try Pizza Day. I directly called him and ordered Two Pizzas and a Fanta. I chose pizza with 3 toppings. I decided on paneer, onion, and corn for the toppings. 30 minutes later and it's ready to deliver.¬†  The pizza day is pretty small. It's definitely a takeout joint. The price is low and the taste is high.¬†  When I took a bite into the first slice of pizza, I could taste the freshness of the ingredients. The fresh tomato sauce really popped out the most. The crust was crunchy on the outside yet with a slight softness on the inside. I'd definitely try again."
313012,"zameto lied to me, where actual delevry time was 0546, they lied that i will receive at 0600 which was recieved at 0628.pathetic service by zometo this time."
313012,"No oregano, chilli flakes topping was there in the order."
301867,Sells stale cakes I advise not to buy cakes from here Once i bought a cake for my brother's birthday and later we found out it was stale and really bad. It ruined my brother's birthday
301867,They have tasty cake and sweets. Small shop with many varieties and quality and price is also very low. They also have Munchies which u can try here.
6475,Inspite of calling the restaurant to remind them to include the mint chutney and the salad  they still forgot and delivered an incomplete order. When I gave them the feedback I was asked to order something again so that they could send it with the new order. Hello!! Is it my fault that you forgot to do your job properly and then I am being told  to order another dish just so that you can make up for your goof up. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!  P.S. : The biryani was pretty average!! A total waste of my money.
6475,We love chicken keema naan and kababs of nazeer's and the craving for the dishes makes us order lot of times...
6475,Good rols and amazing afghan chicken.
300302,"Blandest noodles I have ever tasted in my life, was smelling weird too probably because they did not use fresh ingredients. I ordered prawn noodles and I swear you could hardly notice any prawn in it. Absolute trash of an experience."
300302,"Just love this place. Have been visiting Nikashee since 5 years, and was never disappointed with the food. Value for money!"
300302,I may not be in Delhi but the taste will always remain there and no one can change that .. small place with amazing mouth watering food ... just love the food its a paradise for chinese food lovers thats my take ...quality food and quantity too ... just love it
306166,"After reading a few negative comments lately for this outlet, I had my doubts whether to order from here. But let me tell you, that their momos are great, if you are a real momo lover and know the authentic taste of momo, you would definitely love it. Momos are naturally a lil greasy, people posting negative comments on that are just very used to street side momos, I guess."
306166,"Every item was amazingly horrible. The spring rolls were old or/and double fried rendering the skin burnt and very hard. The filling was nothing but cabbage!!! The pork steamed momos were mainly garlic and onions. U might as well call them that, but then where is the fun in not deceiving people.  The chilli garlic pork was mainly a very oily onion and capsicum thing with some thrice fried hard and chewy meat....cud have been anything but pork. Why else wud it be so badly overdone if not to disguise the meat? Upside: am using the extra oil to lubricate our motorcycle.  For a 5 year old neighbourhood joint that started out nicely, this now serves disgusting food. Wake up and take an interest in ur food and clients guys!!"
305526,The quality of food was so bad it caused food poisoning. Please don't order from here. They don't seem to have any standard of in terms of their ingredients.
305526,"Absolutely fantastic place for South Indian food. Authentic delicacies and great service too. Nothing fancy, just plain and simple South Indian restaurant. The staff is courteous and helpful and they have unique preparations like Palak paneer dosa and Podi Masala which are must trys"
305526,Guys plz don‚Äôt buy anything from here First I found a stone in my food then later found a dead bug in sambar. Horrible in this difficult times we expect restaurant to maintain clean and safety standard And this is how they play with our trust and health...
305526,If ever you want to eat authentic South Indian food in Delhi then this is the place....Simply Pure South Indian  Any South Indian food can be judge by the taste of it's sambhar...and flavors of Chennai serves excellent sambhar
310665,I have ordered twice from here and pretty satisfied with the food quality and quantity. Things ordered: Tandoori chicken momos: 5/5 absolutely loved them. Mutton kakori roll: 4/5 Size was bit small but mutton was juicy well cooked Egg fried rice and chicken fried rice: 5/5 Quantity was too much and tasted yum. It was cooked to perfection.
310665,"What a worst experience i had yesterday, i was waiting for my order and i delivery guy called me and said meet me at some point to take your food, either come to this point or i will not come .... Delivery guy attitude problem"
18163892,The food was really bad. Really oily and not at all tasty. Very poor service. Would never order again. Really really bad food. We ordered tandoori platter and it was very bad in taste. It took a lot of time to deliver and very bad in taste.
18163892,My first visit here was during Navrate. I was fasting those days and had gone to chill at a friend's and that's when I tried their Navratra thaali and it was yumm! That panner was to die for; small victories for those fasting!  My friends tried their mushroom soup and they absolutely loved it while they did complain of too much black pepper.
18163892,"Lemme start with the setting of the restaurant, it is the cutest. I just loved it. Each corner looked and felt so cozy.  Then, we ordered palak paneer, dal makhani and the vegetable platter, along with tandoori roti.  Food was excellent.  And then we ordered gulab jamun with rabri. I couldn‚Äôt click a picture but it was cute too, and the flavour was just perfect.  You must try it.  Overall, my experience with the restaurant was good. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
18163892,"Ordered Malai soya chaap and ginger fizz for home delivery.   Chaap- 3/5 : it was cold but would have tasted better if had at the restraunt    Ginger fizz-2/5: it's a mere flavoured drink. Not worth at all. Instead go for regular fizzy drinks  Overall, I would prefer @degchiwala located right beside Delhi Canteen"
18163892,"Ordered Gattu ki pasand which included mutton biryani with raita but the taste was not so good and the mutton was chewy,the caramellody from the dessert section was yummy though."
18334452,The garlic bread literally has a non melted slice of cheese and garlic pieces cut and sprinkled on top. Absolutely terrible to find that in my order. Though the omelette was decent.
18334452,It's a small cafe situated in Malviya Nagar . Offering Italian cuisine. The taste is good although they can improvise. Have done good efforts as far as interiors are concerned. Recommended if you are around the area.
18334452,Very unfortunate experience. The pancakes were dry and i think were made using wholewheat which made it very hard to swallow. Instead of maple syrup they sent chocolate sauce which did not help. The cold coffee was ok. The pizza was dry and chewy. Had to throw away most of the food which is something I never do. I request you guys please mention if you are serving whole wheat items.
18334452,Food is ok. It wasnt that great! The multigrain bread used in the breakfast platter was hard and didnt taste fresh! The delivery was pathetic. The est delivery was at 11:15 am but I received at 11:55am. Highly disappointing.
18334452,Food was not good. I had ordered aglio olio pasta with chicken.. chicken was just for namesake and it was tasteless. I ordered chicken burger  which was bland and not good at all.
301722,Freshly baked donuts with hot coffee. Best donuts of town are served here . Totally  in love with this place. My favourite is chocolate eclairs and coffee toffee.
301722,"Breakup party donut is love. Amazing range of donuts at awesome price. I am mad over donuts , are you? Try all of these. Death by chocolate and alive by chocolate are my new favourites."
301722,Less variety than promised
301722,ordered for the first time from this particular branch of DD. the order was late and more over I ordered 6 different üç© and I received whatever the people back at DD wanted to serve. the issue was later corrected the very next day but this needs to be looked into.
301722,"First time ordered from this place, it is something different in taste. It was like nicely presented & served. Ya!! I like different types of donuts and their different colors, but my experience were extremely wonderful..  Each and every donuts have their unique taste and their colorful seasoning is really good. I would say, must try this, if you are not aware of it!!! Great experience!!!!"
2586,"The rider was not wearing gloves, he was touching the food packaging without gloves, this should not be allowed during a pandemic!"
2586,"This is located in main market of malviye nagar. They have ample space for seating. It was weekdays evening so place was empty i was only there. Had fish tikka, butter chicken and butter naan.¬† Fish tikka was excellent, chicken chicken can be better, naan were soft and crispy."
131,"This is truly a find. Excellent menu, attentive service, and very good food focused on quality. Their lunch buffet while limited is very good and won't leave you disappointed."
131,"Very Very classy atmosphere and seating Interior design was very nostalgic and the place is huge.  Brilliant service, staff was very courteous  Food was absolutely delicious  Wanton clear soup and hot and sour soup were very nicely loaded with veggies and nice  Mushroom salt n pepper wasn't oily as you find in most of places but nicely cooked, Crunchy and tasted good.  Exotic veggies in garlic sauce was kind sweet and chilly at the same time. Again loaded with fresh veggies which we loved  Hakka noodle veg was a great complement with it.  All of this amazing food washed down with jasmine tea at the end.  We loved everything about our experience here. Will definitely come again"
131,Go only if you want to fall sick. The service was good. That's all. Terrible food both taste and quality wise.  3 of us had gone to the place and all 3 of us are suffering from severe food poisoning.
131,"The only thing good about the dinner tonight was live music. The order taking process was bad, as if the steward was doing us a favour by taking our order. The service delivery was pathetic. Our soup and main course came together, and was kept on our table with main course dishes along side. We were supposed to gobble our soup up fast and the quality of hot and sour chicken soup was pathetic. The after taste of the soup was so bad with zero salt in it. We had to request for the sauces to go with our main course, which the gentleman serving us had forgotten. Just because it was just the two of us. We were being treated as if they were giving us free food. The main course dish that we had ordered was kung Pao chicken with chilli garlic noodles and both of them were tasteless. We were not really sure that the chicken dish was actually Kung pao or not. The service was pathetic and when we wanted to talk to the manager, we were guided to him ... he was one person who actually made us feel as if he was doing us a favour by just listening to us. If you are a couple and looking to eat good Chinese, then we would NOT recommend you to go Chopsticks.  Not recommended AT ALL"
131,"I am totally in love with this place and would love to visit again and again. The ambiance the service and off course food made me extremely happy. The crowd was nice too. The live music reminded me of 80's and 90's. We ordered two types of soups, wonton and mon chow. Both were delicious to core. An amazing experience. Would highly recommend to all. :)"
3555,"This place is horrible!!i have not been there,one of my frend ordered food from here which we got in home!!very poor!!cant imagine so cheap test!!"
3555,"This place remained my mess for daily food for about a year and I must say I was very satisfied with my experience here. They serve lunch and dinner for daily visitors and have a huge parcel system to as far as Munirka. It is by far the best mess/budget daily restaurant in the whole area of Katwaria Sarai. The food is unlimited and the servers are very prompt. Rs. 35 per plate is a bargain anyone would have and especially with the weekly paneer, chicken, poori sabzi and other fixed offerings they have on scheduled days. Not to mention they superb egg curry for just Rs. 5 extra.  The restaurant serves surprisingly tasty and fresh food, way better than the decent mess. I must confess I never expected them to be that good, at par with some of the best combinations of price and quality in different places that have lived. Pick anything on the menu and you wont be disappointed!  ----- 17 Nov, 2012 ----- It is a budget mess for daily food whic is okay.. not good not bad.. good value for money for students..  restaurant is better.. chicken is really good amazing by its standards..  not bad..   food 3/5 service 3/5 value 3.5/5"
18312571,"Visited this place in the evening. When you visit this part of Delhi , it is usually 2-3 degrees lower than the capital average temp. But somehow I seem to love this place because of the peace this place offers.  To beat the cold , we ordered a cup of tea... requested them to put ginger.. what an awesome tea.... for the food, we ordered, kadhai chicken, plain parantha, egg parantha and raita......  The food was really good. The chicken was fresh, soft and overall the gravy was not spicy. You get a complimentary plate of salad with the food. Its not a tiny plate but a big one.. that's why I decided to mention this in the review.¬†  The parathas were very soft and I highly recommend people visiting this place to try out paranthas... they have variety of them.. service was quite and the staff was nice.¬†  Its a roadside eatery so please do not keep very high expectations from the ambiance perspective.  Overall a good experience and I am sure to visit again."
18312571,"This quaint little snack shop serves decent tea and bread toasts... The noodles are also decent... If you overlook the hygiene conditions, it's a decent place for a quick snack in between classes.."
18312571,"This is one of the Dhabas in Qutub Institutional area situated opposite to the Monastery. I have tasted Parashar's aaloo parantha, keema parantha and macaroni. Aaloo parantha served here tops the list. Served with nutralite, pickle and red and green chutney, Parashar's aaloo parantha generously stuffed with mashed potatoes and onions is enough to satiate your hungry tastebuds. Even the macaroni was quite yummy; however, did not like the keema parantha stuffing. Service is quite fast and the waiters are quite attentive. The place is infested with mosquitoes and that's something really annoying. This place is ideal for dining with friends and family in winters."
18025131,"A definite value for money place, good vada paws, you can get a full stomach under Rs.100 that to in hygiene! Like the fact that the paw is air fried while re heating rather than fried again."
18025131,Its jus average place.you cant eat inside better you get packed and have in home!!guys who serve vada paav just unprofessional and illiterate!!vada pav tastes good but not like mumbai wala taste!!
7797,"Nice place to eat in katwaria sarai, there are 3-4 types of thaali here under veg and non veg categories. Apart from thaali you can also order foods from menu. I personally like daal fry and egg curry."
7797,"Ate thali, good service, average cleanliness, location is good, space is a bit small, only four tables for four. Overall, it's a place where you can have cheap foods."
7797,Nice Food... Best for Daily Fooding..........Its Kinda awesome in non-veg............... Service is fast....................................
7797,"Its not hygenic,lack of cleaniness. Veg meal consists mainly potato vegetables. Tastes good,but not much options. Very economical....its not costly. 300 rupees is good amount for 2 people."
7797,best quality food...................chakhna is best.....
18352263,"After office hangovers are quite common in our day to day life & being a foodie only delightful lucious meals can just swipe away the hangovers. So recently ordered from DE PIZZA MAKERS for the first time. In frame had regular size -bbq pizza , spicy pizza, -chunky pizza each costing ‚Çπ 100 each. To be mentioned the food was quite lucious and appetizing. Though local meat was used the taste, texture , flavour and appearance were all up to the mark raising the bars really high for other restaurants. And above all the price was within modest range. So I would recommend De pizza over and over again to all."
18352263,Pizza very testy and good qoulity nice service Very .very good test thanks.da pizza makers and staff Pizza place oder rite very good pizza and very good test
18352263,Order delivered was exactly opposite of order placed. Food quality was very bad. Customer service worst ever. No accountability. And least professional...
18352263,Complete waste of money. Got the order after 2 hours that too was crap. I ordered a cheese Burst and what lacked in the pizza was cheese. Onions too were stale and smelled. 50% of the pizza was bread.
302573,"Well not a good infra,not good ambience,not good locality but food is best nd gives u exact local dhaba taste which is far better than any expensive big chain of restaurant.i had never tried this restaurant coz f crowd and infra,but i was wrong.at times we shud try such restaurants for getting the taste of real street food.Best part of this restaurant they serve tawa roti and home made food!! Highly recommended.get their take away service coz u cant sit there and eat coz f poor infra and heat!!"
302573,This one good when you want to eat special food but not in a lavish restaurant. The food is tasty. I normally eat here on weekends when I dont want to go out in proper restaurants.
18153550,Awesome superfast delivery with tasty food ! Amazing ! Delivered 15minutes before the specified time.. #HatsOff üëç Including the person who delivered the food
18153550,Very much less quantity. I ordered Full plate of Chicken and I got my order in a Quater Chicken packet.  Very much costly also. Try not to buy from this restaurant.
18153550,Found an insect in the food that was ordered for us by our company. Clearly this is a super unhygienic place. Please don't eat from here. Extremely unsanitary.
18153550,"Nice preparation...taste is awesome .best food preparation in this area..no more oil..have been to here manytimes,always fresh items and amazing preparation"
18153550,"Bloody stupid people. I have already eaten food in this hotel. The wife of the hotel owner have no sense how to treat and talk to people. Instead she does partialty by providing food to Bengali people first. No matter how late or early they come. Also she tried to make other people uncomfortable by saying ""DADA PEHLE BAITHA THA USKO KHANA PEHLE MILEGA AAP BAAD ME AAYE THE"". After that incident I have never eaten food in this hotel."
18161591,"The first dhaba you'll find situated in Qutub institutional area. I Ordered mix veg Maggi here, the vegetables weren't fresh and it had a weird smell. Plain masala Maggi comparatively was better."
18161591,"Despite the fact that the area is some 4-5 kms from my house, I yet end up going to this area for its sheer energy even in the calmness around. The order was handled efficiently and piping hot food was server in a jiffy. Slightly on the oilier side when compared to the other adjacent joints, but when you get the taste  when you feel famished you don't really care.  Can however maintain the place slightly more cleaner too and that's where it loses out marginally."
18355275,Place is well located. Good food. Not a lot of space. Only four tables. Ideal place for a quick stop. Television is also available for entertainment
18355275,Food is good and price is reasonable. Specially there chicken items. Chilly chicken is a must try. We were 3 and it cost only 800 for all of us.
18352264,We ordered 6 different parathas n they all were tasteless n smelled like shit.. stuffing was not fresh at all.. but yeah they did send too many ketchup sachets
18414494,Service is slow n serve a little less but taste is good
18414494,Best place for riders as garry paaji is so friendly in nature & serve very tasty foods‚ù§Ô∏è Must try cheese omelette üòç
18414494,Awesome experience and nice taste. Smoothing environment. Must visit  this lane is full of restaurants but this is clean and taste feels mouth watering.
18414494,"So this is a new outlet in the area which is already occupied by a lot of road side stalls, but I must say that it's better than many others. Visited this place for a quick evening snack. Ordered dry veg manchurian. It tasted a little desi and did not have that typical Chinese flavour, but it was good. Chicken soup was really good and was a lot, served in a big bowl. Staff was pretty cordial."
18414497,Amazing poha available from 4 AM. Wonderful place for breakfast. A saviour for students like us who look for healthy and cheap breakfast places in Delhi.
18332442,They are located in qutub industrial area only for home delivery. They have very balanced menu with them. The menu is very economical for all segment of food. They have a variety of combinations like for offices they have a dabba for office people at a very reasonable rate.   As we find a very tasty food stuff and very well cooked. It is very good for this location that this type of food station is running here and serving a good food here. Keep it up.
18312455,"Compare to other restaurants , their quantity was less and they have not any packaging facility , just lifafa packets."
18312455,A humble place serving flavoursome biryani. I tried their muradabadi biryani which cost ‚Çπ100 . The biryani taste good and the chicken and korma gravy is well cooked and are in great portion. For more reviews follow me on instagram @_thefoodassignment #biryani #thefoodassignment
18439705,This place is serves average food. BT the cleanliness of cafe is good . Host is polite and humble . Value for money in some items . Easy to reach
18439705,"My weekend in Delhi took me to the foodies hub for students located in Hauz Khas. It is ‚ÄòThe Hubbub Cafe‚Äô in Jia Sarai, Hauz Khas- its a place that has humongous students crowd in the vicinity and hence this place is their hub. The hubbub serves everything good from Chinese appetizers to Indian mains at so very reasonable price just worthy for a student to spend on for a good meal.  I had an amazing indulgement in some chinese and indian meals out there. Below are my indulgement : üîÜHot & Sour Veg Soup üîÜVeg Spring Roll üîÜAloo Jeera| Butter Roti| Dal Fry  To cut it short, this place should be called an adda or hub not only for students but for all age groups too. Its price is reasonable for a fab and tummy filling meal. An average spend on complete indian thali that you could spend here  is 100 bucks. I would totally recommend this pocket friendly place especially to the youth and students considering their pocket and value for money."
18439705,"Good ambient environment for sitting, and worst food I could find in Delhi. They also use stale ingredients. Would not recommend to anyone. You can better try some nearby outlets, or visit SDA market."
18306540,"Yesterday I went here with my friend for having some food. We order Chhole Chawal, Aloo Dum, Mix Veg, Dal Fry, Makhni Paneer. Lovely and hot food of this outlet which we tried. Yes !!!!!!!!!!! good quality also and presentation was so perfect. One thing was perfect and that was Makhni Paneer..."
18412894,"Very nice staff, not much varieties of cake are available. Not too costly. It is well located and you can easily spot it. And hey, you also get Ice cubes there!"
307171,Everytime favourite food delicious and nutritious healthy Try it ryt now
307171,Please guys don't ordered biryani from Abdul muradabadi they always cheated with clients this thing happened with me 2nd time.
307171,My favourite place to have biryani.... Love it
307865,"A polite staff, very neat and clean surroundings, The taste is refreshing There is no seating arrangement but the shop is attractive The best quality chicken meat is provided A must have!!!"
307865,Good shop for chicken and fishes They also sell burger and pizza and many more Good quality products and safe to eat The shopkeeper is also very friendly
307865,"Located in sector 8 market just opposite to mother dairy i tried  many things from here . This outlet is for take away.i tried chicken and veg burger , sandwiche's  . Chicken breast piece and many things."
307865,Good place for quick bites like chicken burger and veg burgen and chicken tikka roll .the taste of these Two is always awesome but breast chicken was soo dry.it was not fully cooked
307865,"Really bad experience as 1st time i tried veg burger at rk puram branch and they served me expired burger as at the time of having it taste of awful , base was to soggy .....smelling and when i checked date it was expired   Really bad experience"
18428880,Well reataurant is ok ok types.can try once.Offlate m trying rajma from all nearby restaurants and unfortunately i cudn find anyone who can match up with my expectation.but this place is better than other places who serving bad rajma.rajma was nice but again overspicy.I dont get one thing why they cant cook up normal authentic rajma.There should be difference between rajma and rajma masala. Well packaging was nice. Food-3.5/5 need lot of improvement Packaging-4/5
18428880,Guys this new startup offers a good variety of food with a fingerlicking taste. Chilly Chicken is yummy and quite different from other food joints i've tried.¬†  They also offer bulk food for parties and all with good prices. Its surely a must try !
18428880,"Spicy is my thing ....right place for delicate cooked fine takeaway...delivery was shockingly quick, happy customer vdesi next time tandoori"
18428880,Crispy chicken of this place is really amazing and its a must try..... The service is also good and the presentation is too good..!!!  Its a must try people..!!!!
307169,really unhygienic food. had paranthas while price was decent but it was not healthy.
307169,If you are on a budget you don't have that much money to spend in a fine dine restaurant you should go there and have your food they don't have a nice ambience and a nice menu but they do have the simple Indian food. Enjoy eating
307169,"I placed my order from here and observed few things which I would like to share- most of the time I have seen that the restaurants will always juggle between quality and quantity, but this place is exception the quality and quantity was balanced. The packing mechanism was little older and the food wasn't packaged in containers, but I can let that go because of the taste of the food and that there would be no chance of tampering with the food while it is on the way for delivery.  And I want to apologize to the people working there because of an human error (from a toddler) the rating given for the food was a tad low. I hope this would make my mistake right."
307169,"I ordered my lunch from here. Scrolling through the menu I ordered Tandoori Roti thali as it showed ""Bestseller"" but I was a bit disappointed, the Roti's were not properly baked and lassi was so yukk. I would just say whatever u offer at ur price please give justice to that."
18486861,I ordered 1kg Biryani but they delivered only half Kg and apparently Zomato can‚Äôt do anything about it
18486861,"Quantity of food is very less...you provide very less food i ordered two half biryani n u send only one...n customer service number was also not responsive... totally disappointed...never gonna order again.....,........................................................................................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
18486861,I ordered two half kg biryani and I got only one half kg biryani and which Number you provide in this outlet is not working and unsatisfied service
18486861,"Terrible service, mess up my orders many times, plus the quality is getting worse,not recommended, skip this and try some other place,waste."
18472663,"The Best Outlet Which Located at RK Puram i Love Here's Rolls and Wraps, Any Time i am Hungary i choose this Outlet for order rolls or Wraps."
18469974,Be careful do not order pricey pizzas they don't add toppings that they claim on apps that they sell on.
18469974,"Few Days Ago I Ordered Peri Peri Paneer Pizza From here,  Toppings was to Large and Pizza Was so tasty and Soft.  But i am Giving 4 star Because They Not Provide Sufficient Sauce and Packaging is Not Proper."
18469974,"Being a pizza lover, I love ordering from this place. I am a big fan of their veg loaded pizza and picante pizza. base is perfectly baked and toppings are fresh. A lovely balance of tastes on the fine thin crust base.¬† Follow my food journey on instagram- teekhi_mircheee"
18425179,very bad food. quality of kadai paneer was not good :(
18425179,Taste like shit. I can‚Äôt even imagine to finish this whole butter chicken. I don‚Äôt think this is butter chicken it is more of a tomato chicken.. Disappointed. I don‚Äôt think I will be ordering from Rapchik biryani.
18425179,"Eat chicken biryani from here and u will feel like u r in heaven. Their speciality is biryani only. So they r good in biryani and dont expect that they will serve u others food items best in taste. Take korma curry with biryani. Their korma in super tasty. Their chicken is not regular boiled chicken , its marinated and cooked chicken. So u will feel like there is tandoorj chicken in biryani. The taste is awsome and value for money. 50rs/qtr, 100rs/ half (4 chicken pieces), 180rs/ full (6 chicken pieces) . If u buy 2 half biryani then u get total 8 chicken pieces for 200rs only. But u must try their chicken biryani and chicken korma. ITS AWSOME!!!"
18425179,Worst food outlet ever. Ordered afgani chicken and butter chicken. Afgani was fill with bones n very less cream. Looks like a cheap meat. Butter chicken was pathetic. Cooked in shahi paneer gravey. The owner was even clue less and pointed that it's the same way cooked in every restaurant. Please save money order from Sindhi snacks.
18352172,The chicken tikka was fried instead of grill it had bad smell Then butter naan was not fresh it also had faul taste.. chicken malai tikka was all mashed.. the salad n 1 butter naan had human hairs..!!
18352172,Sindhi cuisine being very vast and extra varied one they don‚Äôt have the authentic Sindhi taste. The dishes are really very oily and the quality of ingredients and raw material was below average.
18352172,"I tried butter chicken, butter naan along with chicken seekh roll. Everything was too delicious.The roll was spicy. Their delivery service is also good. They serve food at affordable price. You must try once."
18352172,Please guys don't order from sindhi snacks this restaurant was not accept any order if you order your payment was blocked & no any order be careful
18352172,packaging not done properly.
18434343,"But,butter is not in a tandoori roti"
18434343,Been here for the first time. And loved tandoori chicken.. Though the ambiance would give a mixed feeling but trust me the taste of tandoori chicken is comparable to headquarters CP!!
18472665,Murgh kefta was out of the world especially with the dip they provided with. Mutton haleem was fine although the required spices were less. Total disappointment was bhuna murgh biryani which was sweet in taste. It completely spoilt the idea of having biryani on Eid. Behrouz specialises in biryani and it is important they don‚Äôt make blunders like this one.
18472665,Best biryani in town
18472665,Ordered mutton biryani by my friend for himself & me just 30 min ago....There is no masala nor any mutton pieces in it...Pathetic
18427212,"I had ordered through zomato and idk what happened but two of my orders were messed up. I had ordered 2 chicken rolls but they gave 2 paneer instead.¬† And the soya malai chaap I ordered just tasted so weird.  Since I had ordered 4 different rolls, they did not write on their covers for me to differentiate. Though their mutton seekh roll was good."
18427212,Horrible taste. I have eaten from this outlet twice. Uncooked mushroom. Wastage of money
18427212,"I ordered three rolls; mutton seekh, chicken tikka and paneer bhurji. 5/5 on taste! The delivery was quick and the packing was effective, no messy business here."
18427212,I ordered a mutton roll. Wow just wow. It was so delicious that it for sure be became a favourite. I recommend it to all my friends and family all the time. Ah here I go craving it again
18427212,"34 CL is honestly my favourite roll place. It's original, tasty and very easily available. With so many options to pick from both in vegetarian and non-vegetarian, it's hard not to fall for their rolls."
313127,"A good place for family dining. Ground floor sweethouse and first floor is restaurant, making it a perfect combo.The Shahi paneer is a speciality here."
18396151,It's a small take away outlet in r k puram sector 9 and chinese is famous from here specially momos and chowmin.chicken burger is also good.
18396151,"It's a van and i ordered veg chowmien , manchurian and spring roll the taSte of these are awesome and manchurian is very famous. It's not that much costly."
18396151,"Located just beside R.K.Puram sector 1 bus stop,this small joint has got some real potential.They just won't compromise on the hygeine,Ive tasted almost every dish.  Service Dishes are prepared swiftly with a hard street presentation and style.The owner seems to be a nice and helpful person.  Ambience Sadly, the location does play as a major drawback. There is no seating available, just a few small tables where one stands and eat.  Taste Spring rolls Soft texture,very well done vegetables with a good amount of moisture retained,but they can be too spicy sometimes.  Chilli potato I won't rate them as the best ones I ever had( they have the potential though) because the consistency in the taste is never maintained. They would sometimes be the best ever had category and other time they'll have a weirdly strong green chilli taste. Overall,you should try it yourself.  Noodles Just average, a hardcore street style chowmein with bombarding sharp spice just enough to kill my junk food craving. But as I said it overall would taste just fine and not to great.  Sauce Since all the items here taste like real street dishes ,the hot sauce just not touches that spicy point.It has a sharp vinegar taste which dominates your taste buds.They really need to work upon the taste of momo sauce.  Great food,but I prefer you try it for delivery and takeaway only."
18486869,The combo packages are deceptive... They provide less quantity however the food quality is alright.. I ordered Chili Chicken with noodles combo... and I swear there was more of Onion and 3 small pieces of chicken..and that was not even flesh..  the noodle was too less probably it will not even fill a kid tummy
18486869,"Zomato is bloody fraud, the price in the menu from the restaurant and price here are different. Food not properly sealed and not this. absolutely shameful on part of zomato. Bread section price are totally different"
18486869,The food from here is totally yummy and you better make loads of space for it in your tummy! The Bhindi Masala and Palak paneer are really delicious. The quality of the vegetables and spices is great. The food quantity is more than sufficient. The food is also affordably priced. Definitely worth repeating.
18486869,I had ordered Chicken Biryani. The taste was okay but the quantity was very less and was not at all worth the amount. But the restaurant is good you can try out some other dishes.
18486869,test is not good
18486866,"Tried the north indian thali. For a night delivery, the food was not bad but might be little unhealthy. Also, I doubt the hygiene level. Thali costed me approx 200 rs. So anyone craving for North indian thali can try it!"
18486866,Ordered- Butter chicken   Taste-4/5 Price-4/5 Packaging-3.5/5  The butter chicken was very good and actually even I didn‚Äôt expected that the dish would turn out to be so good from this place.  Butter chicken (worth a try)  The ambiance of the place is low but you can take away the food for home
18486866,"Butter chicken is not like your usual sweet makhni gravy,  their butter chicken is  spicy and buttery full of taste and full dhaba style if you're  looking for a good desi butter chicken then you should go for this,  i always pack my order and eat at home with family."
18461352,"A mini dhaba with good food. Whenever you walk around in the lanes of Munirka and wish to have good food this Dhaba is one of them. Serving ghar ka khana at reasonable rates. One can try Kosha Mangsho, Chicken curry and rice. Whatever you try here gives you proper taste. Rupa Aunty keeps her customers entertained with gossips so you will have a proper channel of entertainment with food. Next time when you don't feel like cooking or you wish to change your dhaba. Rupa Bengali Dhaba is recommended. Food- 4 Value for money- 4 Ambiance- Is small shop so (2)"
18057802,"Cheap,value for money,neat and raat food"
18057802,It's a very small restaurant with limited seating. You may end up sharing seats as well. The whole vibe of the place is very welcoming.  The food is just fantastic especially the pakoras and filter coffee.  I talked to the owner. It's a common hangout place for cyclists especially on a weekend. There are some pics of the groups that frequent the place.  Would definitely recommend coming here
18057802,"Want some tasty and pocket friendly south Indian khaana, toh aur kahi nahi jaana. Visit Mysore Cafe for some scrumptious food.  üî∏Mysore Pak, amazing sweet dish üî∏Idli, soft with coconut chutney and Sambhar was just perfect. üî∏Onion Masala Dosa, so crispy and filled with onion masala, and served with coconut chutney and Sambhar. üî∏Set Dosa, this was a new item for me which was just amazing. üî∏ Coffee and Tea were just the perfect beverages.  This cafe is very authentic and the ambience is very pleasing. Staff is very courteous.  Food-5/5 Service-5/5"
18057802,Its a typically south indian food restaurant. All items are tasty and cost effective. Spl dosa and coffee are the best ‚òùÔ∏è   Mostly people working nearby will go there .
18057802,And here is a gem which serves  delicious south indian food and is not well known. Finally we visited this place and loved everything we ate. Upma was so full of flavours and was so different  then what we usually get at other restraunts just for ‚Çπ50. Then we had bombay dosa and what a delicay it was. Usually we do not like combination of cheese and dosa but they had incorporated cheese so well that we couldnt stop munching. The dosa was so heavily  filled .These two items are a must try.
312231,Not sure about the entry process but now I have something to rely on even with a 50 rs note in my pocket .....Chicken for rs 48 and rice rs 15....Yes guys that's the price ....A veg meal around 40-50 bucks....Yes guys a real meal under rs 100....Don't judge the taste....Just fill it in...
312231,For some one who has lived in that area ..its an old haunt...sundar sasta tikau is what u will describe it as...a good cuppa of tea and some paranthas with bhaji is what we had for breakfast..hot and piping!
312231,not worth at all.better you can have bread and butter at home.
312231,"Great location. But the quality of food was not good. There was only thali available that costs just Rs 50/-. Even for that, there was no value for money. 100% chance of improvement."
312231,"It's such a pleasant surprise !!¬† Have been going to this place since my teens, have seen many caterers changed.  This time it has changed for the best. I had one of my best meals ever at this place. Be it Masala Dosa, Sysore dosa or simple idli-wada, each item was fresh, well prepared and tasty.  Can go there any number of times. Been there for breakfast, however there dinner and lunch menu looks equally exciting, with the endless array of north indian, south indian, chinese and non-veg dishes.  Great food, decently priced, clean, airy and open to all.  It is in south avenue in one of the MP quarters, ¬†opposite to the Safal depot (near 3 Murti Bhawan) Must visit place."
18481278,Excellent food.....Great service....... Friendly staff..... They really went out their way to accommodate...... Must try their Bhuna Murg And tandoori chicken !!!!!!!
18481278,"Recently opened,astonishing taste,very calm ambiance,staff is very friendly,loved the area behind ‡§∞‡§æ‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡§™‡§§‡§ø ‡§≠‡§µ‡§®‡•§ please do try once. Both tandoor and gravy items are amazind."
311828,Great butter chicken and makhan daal. I would suggest just sticking to these things as the biryani was disappointing. Delivery has always been within the time.
311828,"Very unhygenic ,Unhealthy and over spiced food. We had odered for a home delivery. First we got late delivery then it was wrong order. on calling again the person on the orherside had confirmed that it was wrong orde then he sent it but the total dinner time for us took almost 2.30 hours. The worst was we both fell sick same night due to the same. The Mutton curry and biryani was below average. Some restaurant guys dont understand that taste doesn't mean thick gravy and loads of spices."
311828,"Portions are small and confusing. Half butter chicken is enough for two people but half paneer dish is tiny! Mutton curry(Rogan Josh) is very bad here. And their prices in their printed menu, here and on other food platforms are all different (this is something govt will have to regulate soon)! Place has no sitting arrangements, it's only a takeaway or home delivery restaurant. Butter chicken is good here. They may not give bill if you buy directly from them, so don't hesitate to remind them about it."
311828,"They can‚Äôt even update the address correctly. The lady at the counter is clueless, the gentleman interacts well."
311828,Delivery was quick but the taste still need to improve..It was too flat.. Mushroom was flat but eatable..Little more work on tarse will work for u guys .I am a regular customer and this is th 3rd time I  find it same in tatse so thought of sharing..
18126972,Please don't ever order from this place.. worst service ever.. its been more than 1:30 hours since the order. No reply from the restaurant. No reply from Zomato. Moreover I paid online so now I should just forget about it.
18126972,I order a chicken paratha combo and tandoori chicken.. It was really nice and combo was completely worth having and even the tandoori chicken was great.....
18126972,"I have been ordering food from here for years and can honestly say they are head and shoulders above all competitors in Delhi, not only in terms of cost but also quality. Superbly efficient and tastes great too. They always made perfect food and arrives hot. Always done to my taste. Good and friendly service everytime."
18126972,Good yummy tasty food served by this restaurant and additional benefit is the price is also less as per the quality and quantity... Highly recommended
18126972,I ordered tandoori chicken prantha and butter chicken both were tasty and money spend on was worth it .thanks for providing food in night odd hours .keep it up guys üëç
5846,Cannot be eaten felt the veg not wash properly and feel stone's in the food
5846,Got momos without any filling. It‚Äôs just a ball of maida. Who does that. Beware of these guys !!!
5846,It's a good place to have Chinese food..Ordered their Hakka noodles and they were amazing..It tastes so good and the Quality of the food is too A1....It is a Must try their Hakka Noodles..Value for üí∞!!
5846,It was not as good as I thought it to be. Ambience was nice. Music gone wrong. The butter naans were really good. Haryali chicken tikka was the best of the lot. Chicken rarha was good but too oily. Peas pulao was very very dry. We also ordered lemon ice tea but got lemonade. It was replaced instantly but the taste was awful. The best part of the meal was the chicken haryali tikka and butter naan.
5846,"Great Place For Food and Dining, I visited this place with my family loves it....food is delicious and mouthwatering recommends it to all..."
18456770,Serving cold pizza !!! Not very good Napoli !!!!
18456770,"I ordered the southern barbecue pizza, it is the best pulled pork pizza I have had! The barbecue sauce is really good.  Margarita pizza was also good, the base and cheese on top is just amazing"
18456770,"I am ordering there repeatedly. And while the pizza itself is actually really good, they often do not deliver what you order. Putting tomato sauce on a pizza bianco, or putting tons of sausage on a vegetarian pizza. I fail to understand why, especially as the quality overall is so good."
4330,"We had ordered food online from them and it was the most pathetic experience we had. The packaging was so poor that by the time food arrived, the boxes started leaking of oil. The Paneer tikka was definitely stale as the paneer was rubbery and the taste was awful. Waste of money to order from this place. Furthermore, I am definite that the restaurant has 0 hygiene levels."
300281,"Reasonable price and yet amazing food ,I love their momos so much I might be having a private affair with their momos ,it's juicy and moist on the inside but nice and fluffy on the outside ,right now I'm waiting for my orders to be delivered ,big surprise the dish I ordered (momos )"
300281,"Good quantity and value for money, but should have half portion also as an option"
300281,"The chef is an amazing chinese restaurantüëç, chicken momos was delicious, this was the best chicken roll I ever had. Both quality and quantity of food was really nice accompanied with amazingly chilled fruit beer."
1774,The quality of food was pathetic.. I just have to through all the food in dustbin.. Highly disappointed with the food quality and delivery boy.. Not going to buy anything from this place future for sure.. wasted my money
1774,"I was having cravings for some good brownie so i went here to have chocolate brownie. The price of brownie was Rs 70 but it was not good as compared to price, it was a little bit hard and didn‚Äôt seemed fresh.  I also tried chocolate pastry which was okayish in taste Didn‚Äôt have a good experience  Rating: 3/5"
305606,"Ordered online. They didn't received order. Took over 1 and half hour for delivering simple items. Packing was not good either. I ordered aloo paratha,paneer paratha,gobi paratha Nd malai chaap. It was edible but nothing tasted good. So better avoid this one."
305606,"Ordered butter chicken, the guy prepared it in front of me, used the chicken which was on display probably the stale one. I watched him as he cooked, he generously used all the ingredients making half a litre gravy for literally two pieces of chicken. The cashier cut the pieces of naan on his cash desk which was full of dust and said 'sir abhi saaf kia hai ye apke samne'. Food was rubbish I threw it in the dustbin."
305606,"I ordered veg sandwich, fried rice, chicken chowmein and chilly potato. It was very worst food. Sandwiches r yuck, and smell of coconut oil and fried rice qu√†lity was so bad. Wastage of money"
305606,zustyummy katwaria saria restaurant  First order they will give more quantity of chicken later they will reduce subsequently.¬†  i ordered from FOODpanda ¬†and faced this issue...dont order again
305606,"The best thing is their timeliness Apart from that, food is tad on the spicier side. Staff is really warm. It's good for me, as store is close by.  Good for fast food"
18357527,"They Never picked up my calls for orders................::::::,.......................     ... ..... ...... ............................,...........,,...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
18357527,"Best Nepali muttan thali in town  Authentic nothing over exaggerated Owner is very worm and welcoming and has a nook for TV series. Over all I love the place great food good decor, worm and cozy"
18357527,"I rarely give a five star rating but this restaurant has won my heart in terms of food, ambience and hospitality. Not so pricey and the food is level best. Locating this place might be a little hiccup but give them a call they are better than google maps.  Small tip: Go for their choilas and pork curry. The taste is Highly satisfying."
18357527,"Aren't I glad that we decided to not eat at the other usual joint we go to for lunch?!EVERYTHING is just right here!Cost effective? YES!VFM? YESQuality? GREAT!Service? GREAT!Food? GREAT!We had the thalis for lunch: 2 chicken and a fish one. Every thing that came as part of the spread was delicious. The flavours were, might I say, way better than Yeti AND Lama combined as this was authentic Nepalese food for me cooked with care and actual passion.Post that, I even ordered the Veg thali and Chicken meatballs in gravy with rice for dinner. And lo-n-behold they were awesome as well.I'm totally impressed by the joint and shall be a patron, as well as, a promoter.P.S.: The owner is really polite and pays keen attention to what one requests which is seldom seen these days.Go guys! What are you waiting for???If Nepalese food and the other Continental fare (for the not so adventurous folks) are what you seek, this is a wonderful option.Cheers!"
18357527,"One of the best places to munch when you are in safdarjung! Freshly baked buns/breads with amazing variety of food. Ever smiling staff and good music too.¬†  Treat up cafe is my go to place whenever I am hungry!  Must Try - Burgers, Flat Breads, Cheese Balls, Cold Coffee, Pan fried bbq chicken!  Over All - 10/10."
18337920,Nice food  Nice service  Very nice vegetarian burger  And chicken shawarma  Pasta very nice  Weird time food Safdarjung New Delhi  Food 5/5 Service 5/5
18337920,Great portions. Indianized Mexican but largely delicious. Great enchiladas. Also food is always piping hot and well packed. Complete value for money.  PS: I have only had their pastas and Mexican mains. Not sure about their desi fare.
18337920,Ordered hummus pita.. Hummus was sufficient in quantity..pita was dry... The hummus was not at all good in taste... The delivery guy was rude as if he is paying me to eat the food. Never ordering again
18337920,"Quite impressive for an ""after hours"" food delivery service. Food arrived on time, was hot on arrival, properly packed and tasted quite good. I had ordered chicken and fries for starters and herbed chicken served with a side of mashed potatoes and grilled veggies. Quantity was more than expected and was good enough for two people. At a 20% discount offer being available at the time the food was definitely value for money.   In terms of improvement their online menu on a different app doesn't feature any drinks option. Choice of nonveg pasta was limited only to chicken lasagna. Didn't see much variety in their main course options beyond chicken and a couple of fish items.  Overall I would definitely like to give this place another try in the near future."
18337920,"Lovely late night dinner today. Ordered the classic club sandwich, mushroom burger and chicken burrito it was pleased by the quality and taste of the chicken as well as in all the items. Mushroom burger was fingerlicious, sandwich was stuffed so nicely with chicken and bacon. A very good experience."
300280,"Loved the ambience. The staff is very friendly and food is also nice and fresh. If you're looking for some authentic tibetan food that doesn't cost you a fortune, this might be the place."
300280,Amazing and very humble staff...easy on the pocket and very yummy food. The chowmein is also very tasty. The tibetan puri and dry alu dum is also a must try.   üòãüòãüòãüòã
300280,"Wandering in the narrow lanes of Humayunpur, we decided to try out this litlle joint. The ambience is basic, nothing fancy. The tables and chairs are set up in a simple manner and they have on display a variety of chutneys and pickles on sale in the front window. We had gone for a chicken thali and two pork thalis. They come with the meat alongwith dal, rice, a vegetable and salad. Was not impressed at all with the food. Only the dal was okay. The chicken and the pork were bland and tasteless. Service was very slow as well even though only two tables were occupied. Skip this place the next time you are in these lanes. Totally not worth the money and time."
300280,Awesome food...Great ambience Amazing staff.. finger licking good And even the location is near to chowk so easy to locate.. I recommend it to all
300280,"I love druk restaurant..it's chow mein is amazing..really love their shaptalay too, I recommend the pork chow mein..their delivery is outstanding too"
7310,"Me and my friends visited here with no plans but this place win our hearts , the service here is also very good ,loved this place ‚ô°"
7310,"I checked in into the restaurant with no plans. And I don‚Äôt know how reviews of others are different from mine.   I ordered Alu Tikki Chat and two Chinese items: Singapori Rice and Manchurian Gravy. For me everything was superb and great. Perfect to meet expectations of my taste buds.   at the end: Food was good, service was decent enough, value of money was full"
7310,To prepare food they take some time but food is good...overall.. Rates are lil bit high...
7310,"Seating and ambience of this outlet is nice but don't expect your taste buds to be totally satisfied I had chole bhature, stuffed kulcha, cheeze sandwich and deluxe or some king thali and I didn't liked any of them."
7310,I had dinner there. Food is over priced but the taste is justify. The place is clean food was good service was good. I ordered chinese. A good option for vegetarians
18219526,"Ordered Two crispy chicken Makhni burgers. The first burger was fine but the second Burger's Patty was stale, the nachos were soggy and the sauce smelled fermented. I can only hope other customers do not experience this lack of effort and quality check"
18219526,Order food at 2am yet they cancelled my order at 2:15 and they did not even tell me why did they cancel. Promising to deliver food till 3am yet cancelling orders. What a great way to run a food business.
18458306,it was quite Nice!
18458306,"They're a good outlet if you're looking out for slightly less costly sushi.  Still have no idea why sushi is still expensive in India but anyway.  They had some decent sushi but i thought their rice was a bit dry and the rice wasnt properly coated with vinegar which usually is the case.  I tried :  1) Dynamite: Salmon, Spring Mayo, Prawn Tempura. (Highly Recommend)  2) Rainbow Roll: Salmon, Tuna, Avocado, Crab, Cucumber (Highly Recommend)  They both turned out to be nice sushi rolls, i just wished the above points were taken into notice and they will be a complete brand then."
18458306,Pathetic California roll. It tastes stale.
18458306,"Good Sushi option as their price point seems to be just right. I don‚Äôt think their expensive, or cheap. They‚Äôve managed to find a perfect niche in this almost saturated sushi market in Delhi. They used to serve sushi burritos (which I used to enjoy) I‚Äôm not sure if they serve it. Do try their rainbow rolls if you want their best item, and it may not be a terrible idea to give their California roll a miss."
18458306,there was no cream cheese in their cream cheese and avocado roll :(
300258,I recently visited this outlet of Cafe Coffee Day and it‚Äôs nice. Their crackle brownie with ice cream is my all time favourite. Must try if you are a brownie fan.
300258,Ambience was great!!! Pleasing atmosphere had a great time with friends. The taste of coffee was so nice. Totally loved it. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5
300258,Incomplete order received with 2 missing items. The Restaurant's number is out of reach. Really poor and unexpected service from such a renowned brand.
300258,The vanilla coffee was served hot and nice I didn't like the taste of the paneer Sandwich that I had. It was serves with fe potato wedges. Ccd serves one of the most delicious coffees. It's one of my favorite outlets from past 7 years.
18144483,"I got to say the first time I had ordered pork ribs from you guys - it wasn't a great experience - BUT hands down to all of you for following my suggestion and registering my complaint in true hospitality sense.  When I ordered the next day, your pork ribs were heavenly and delicious. I have become a die hard fan of your food.  Keep up the good job. Thank you."
306870,Nothing great. Just satisfactory. The food is fine. And the delivery is also fine. The Ambiance is okayish. The taste is also just satisfactory
306870,the quality has gone down....its was a famous place but now its a heads down.their specialitybwas butter chicken and that has gone way down now not at all happy with it .
304186,Hangchua's Chinese food corner is an ideal place to eat Chinese delicacies. Their food has perfect chinese flavours and spices. I really like their shredded lamb  chicken lollipop and chicken fried rice
304186,"Few days back, I ordered chilli fry mutton momos from this place called Hangchua's Chinese food corner. The momos were perfectly cooked and stuffing was amazingly good. Will definitely try more dishes from this outlet."
304186,Hangchua's Chinese food corner is a premium place to order authentic Chinese food. I personally recommend everyone to try their shezwan noodles. They are perfectly long and spicy. Must try
304186,If you want great food at minimal price then this is the place you and all of us are looking for. I mean one should really try this place out with their friends and enjoy!  üëÄ
304186,My friend recently took me to this place and we tried their chilli Chicken fry momos and shezwan fired rice. The food was awesome and the place was also quite clean and hygienic. Their prices are also pocket friendly. Definitely a place to visit.
8216,"Used to visit this place a lot, and have had almost every item on the menu. It is great for satisfying the craving, but overall, the place is okayish. The place has a lot of great desserts, but nothing that really stands out for me. It has outdoor tables that one can stand and keep their food on. Would recommend having their grilled sandwiches if you visit the place."
8216,Made a takeaway from this outlet last evening. My order had veg burgers and chilly paneer sandwich. The food is simple and cheap.Seating is not available
8216,"Allu Patti 6 pointer amazing sandwiches the only thing I m disappoint with is drinks, they should improve their drinks. Over all its a good place to grab your snacks"
8216,"Only giving a 5 star review for it's huge impact on my life since I was an awkward preteen girl who has had play-dates, crush spotting, friends chilling, parents fighting and not feeding food etc. at this bakery. The menu is limited but who cares? Baker's byte is a landmark for all SJE peeps because once in their life, it has saved them for one reason of another. Still love their grilled sandwiches. Always will."
8216,"Love their bread pizzas!!.... very hygenic , tasty , full of cheese and toppings üòã and the best part, it costs just 50 bucks !! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ Nice place for a quick bite!"
18384121,"Literally the best place eat at Safdarjung, humble staff and authentic north eastern food. Even while quarantine/lockdown this is the place to trust when it comes to hygiene and when you're missing home a bit too much. Love it."
18384121,The food was very bad which doesn't deserve to be in zomato and it is so expensive like 390rs an 30 rs for delivery. I think this shop should be thrown out. If there was zero rating then I would have given zero nono...I would have given minus zero such a bad food which doesn't even deserve 1 rs. Very very very very bad chicken. Too spicy which was just boiled and served. Third class quality I mean zero class quality. Never ever buy from here. I request never ever buy from hereü§£
300235,Parathas  this guy is serving are real treat. JUST DON'T GO BY OUTER LOOK OF SHOP. ....taste one and you will reorder it....do taste free Allo gravy Sabji they give along with Parathas.
300235,"I love this place for the versatile parathas. It's quite safe, can tell based on experience. It's very close to my place and I frequent it for the tasty parathas."
300235,"Just a roadside Dhaba, No Quality, Hygiene maintained, Broken Chairs, Doesn't have a proper place to sit and dine. Parathas are normal, not that awesome to die for."
300235,Mmmmm.... Diarrhoea. Loved every minute of it. With a hint of cholera on the side.
300235,"Very small place on the IGNOU Road. Its more like a dhaba than anything else. I was traveling once in the IGNOU direction and found this place. I have tried its food jut because it offered raita and it was hot during that evening.  Not much to talk about place. The food was just ok-ok. I ca not assure of any hygiene. The road dirt, pollution would find solace in its food as the food is cooked on road. But I liked raita, may be coz of heat or may be it was genuinely good.   There is no seating arrangement. Just pack your food and go home. Though they offer a large variety of Pananthe, they also have Chole-rice, chole-bhature in their menu. I tried their Chole-rice other time and must confess they were freaking spicy.   Overall: Would not go there unless in night I am hungry with just a 50 rupee note in my pocket."
18428536,"Ordered Burgers from this place...I ordered aloo tikki, veg burger,veg surprise burger and French fries. It was packed nicely, the amount of filling used was perfect but the lettuce and the veggies could have been better in terms of quantity You can try this place if you want a pocket friendly place to eat. The burgers were value for money I must say."
18428536,#Big Belly Burger# I have ordered sausage burger and white sauce pasta they both taste very great and the texture of pasta was so delicious and worth for it's money üòã
18428536,"The food was really delicious and not very costly. The quantity was pretty sufficient, I just think the staff should be more aware and attentive while taking down the orders."
18428536,I visited this place with my friend. I ordered fries and veggie burgers from this place . And I was really satisfied with the taste of food. The delivery was on time. And packaging was really good . I recommend this place. You must try it once.
18428536,i m totally satisfied with the burger its big in size and full of cheese and I love it!
302326,"Their sitting area so comfy and the sandwiches are good and what I loved the most was brownie, so delicious and mouth watering th"
302326,This is road side small restaurant where they make lots of chinese and Italian food along with burger and sandwiches and they are really affordable .Not all the food they sell is good but you will surely love their mustard chicken sandwich üòä
302326,Mene swiggy se chicken cheese burger order kia tha in logo ne sadha hua ganda burger de dia ghin aagyi mujhe ab kbhi yha se kuch nhi mangunga sada hua khana milta hai yha overpriced hai
302326,nice job
302326,I use to Order Sandwich and Pasta from Pooja sandwich and Some days ago I have Ordered Pasta and that was really good with valuable Price Taste : ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Price : ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê I will recommend to all my friends
309192,The rating of this place do not do justice to the kind of place it is...The food quality is undoubtedly very good and it is priced very reasonable. .will definitely recommend this place...
309192,Cake was good and met my expectations but pathetic customer service guys. Never picked my phone on time. I had to call her like zillion times to get her attention . Even the delivery was 2-3hrs late.
309192,It was my daughter's first birthday and thanks to Bake Studio for making the occasion more beautiful with the prettiest and yummiest Castle cake . It might be a little highly priced than some of the home bakeries but you can rely on this bakery with your eyes closed.
309192,"Home bakers are a new concept that‚Äôs picking like crazy, sure we did have our aunts baking for us, when we were kids,  but those were simple cake made in cookers or simple OTG‚Äôs. These days you can get any kind of customization Shape/color/taste, and I feel we should encourage the clan of home bakers in whatever little way we can.  My SIL‚Äôs baby shower was planned last week, since I am new in Gurgaon, my knowledge about places to order cake or anything is very limited. I checked with some bakeries near my place and also few good bakeries in Gurgaon, however I was not very convinced that they would be able to give me what I want, so I requested on FB for someone who could help me with it. And came across Ritika‚Äô s ‚ÄúThe Bake Studio‚Äù. I contacted her and we decided on the design that I had picked up from Pinterest. I don‚Äôt like fondant so we decided to stick to Buttercream frosting and simple vanilla flavor, Ritika suggested we also add blueberry as it will enhance the taste, and true to her suggestion- the cakes taste was elevated.   Ritika herself delivered the cake, we had a little mishap on the way, the cake decided to slip to the side of the box, but Ritika was able to quickly get it repaired:)  The cake was as expected hit and since they were baked freshly it tasted awesome. The sweetness was not perfect, the butter cream was not laden with sugar which I hate. And my SIL loved the cake, we have preserved the fondant shoes in the freezer.   Though the cake was little expensive compared to normal cakes you get, almost 2K/kg (this was 1.5kg), but the smile on my SIL‚Äôs face was worth it.  Thank you ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Bake Studio‚Äù."
309192,"The Bake Studio Cakes are really Delicious and Yummy. Bachhe to Bachhe, Boodhay Bhi Mangay More and More......... and very timely delivered."
300236,It was an average place to hangout and easy some quick snacks. I packed 5 samosa and half kilo jalebi. Samosa was aptly fried but jalebi was too sweet and too fragile.
300236,I have tried many outoet of bikaner misthan but was diappointed with the quality and hygine if the food. Taste was good but one cannot compromise with the hygine.
300236,"Their sweet shop is good but I visited to there restaurant which was on first floor. The atmosphere over there was too bad. Sitting area was very small, suffocated place, no hygiene. Service and food was okay.  I recommend for their sweet shop only."
300236,Very bad quality and very bad service they do not work quickly and test of the food is very bad Do not come here for dinner It is totally waste
300231,"This place is amazing. Love his chowmein, dhokla and samose. Amazing taste. Even sweets are really good esp jalebi. Pls be available on Zomato for online order."
300231,"The samosa's were tasty, from this outlet it was first time ordering. Everything was fine, properly given everything and separately. So you can taste üëÖ the yum samosa's from here."
300231,I ordered Dhokla from here and it was really amazing in taste. It was having a good taste without too much of oil or anything. It‚Äôs really good.
18303837,"Worst pizza ever...I ordered meatza cheeseburst. It was filled with mayonnaise in it...it was smelling lyk hell...not at all baked properly...no cheese,no mozzarella, chicken used was not at all good...pizza base was pathetic... very baddd experience...after having this pizza my stomach got upset and in morning it all came out from my mouth... don't even want to give single star...waste of money..."
18303837,If you place an order they call and say that the shop is nearby come to the shop and eat. What kind of service is this? very extremely dissapointed
18303837,Need some improvement of your services.
18303837,very bad service I got my order after 1:30 hr and delivery time was 39 minutes and ordered spicy dips and I got cheesy dips
18488864,Recently me and my friends visited pie outlet as we have to heard there various awesome and different variations in food. Burger ice cream here is a must try in starting I was hesitating to try it but glad we did as it was delicious. We also ordered veg delight and paneer pizza which was also good along with veg burger. They also have some reasonable and amazing combos too.
18488864,"Heard about this outlet few days back thru one of my friend who had some good Review about it so ordered some good and cheesy stuffs from here!  Had this unique sweet affair- Ice Cream Burger, filled with Gajar Halwa and scoop of Vanila Ice cream (you have choice of Flavors) .. too good with this tasty experience. Another one was Veg wrap, that was crispy and mouthwatering to enjoy. I also had this Paneer mushroom , it has good portion. Base was superb and so the toppings were. Will definitely order few of the more items from PIE in my next encounter...and definitely recommend people to try their Burgers and Pizzas.."
18488864,"Amazing food from Pie , this is a delivery outlet which is delivering food in Saket, Malviya Nagar and Pancheel Park.  Had Chicken Burger, Wraps Veg and Non Veg one with Veggie Delite Pizza.  Great experience , Chicken Burger was quite good with the Juicy Chicken Patty.  Wraps and Veg Burger was good as their filling too was quite good.  Veggie Delite pizza was awesome as they use authentic Mozzarella Cheese which is imported from Italy.  Their Ice Cream Burger is a must try which is available at this place, and do try their Burger Ice Cream in Gajar ka halwa flavor."
18488864,Yesterday me and my brother ordered veggies overloaded pizza 4 slices and paneer delight 2 slices. Veggies overloaded pizza was a delight and tasty and so was paneer delight. We also ordered its new wrap which was sumptuous. Its yet another special variety Keema Burger was a bit letdown as the the bun was sweet and fillings could be more masaledar.
18488864,"Simply mind blowing !!! I tried the place with so much apprehensions and ooh la la the place turned out to be a revelation. What a concept which at the outset was weird to hear but when the humble offering melted on my palate which is predominantly very indian, the taste buds simply asked for more.... Can u believe a combination of hot buns sandwiching the cool icecream within along with gazar halwa. It just won me over ensuring me to keep going back to the place."
2201,"The blue tandoor is basically a take away and home delivery restaurant in Sainik Farms,  they used to have dine in too till couple of years back but now its only for take away and home delivery.  The prices are a bit on the higher end considering its not dine in but the food quality is good,  taste is delicious.  We had Gilafi Murg Kabab , Afghani kabab ,Kadai murg, Dal Makhani along with assorted breads. The delivery was prompt.  The restaurant is located on the main gate of Sainik Farms opposite Saket."
312827,The malai kofta has no taste .... Salad cucumber was bitter... Kadhi rice was tasteless too...didn't have a single besan pakoda but an overload of raw tomatoes...need to improve a lot
312827,No consistency on taste.. egg curry sometimes like kadi.. quantity of full noodles or fried rice is very disappointing
312827,I went to this place and first of all this place was not hygienic at all there were flies around hence ordered fried rice and i think it was the worst food anyone can ever eat i have to throw it in the dustbin although i don't do that however that was not eatable at all
302314,Food was okay okay ...not too great...fzjznhdnnxxnvfnfzjjxjhnhznngjbzfndggdjbghfnfhfh xjfnghfhnodgiakkse9enxkxjjdznnsiffbjsgjddnvduvnjd jfsnjfdbjfd
302314,"My favourite place for rabdi! They have got perfect rabdi, very well packed and it tastes heavenly. Highly highly recommended. Can never go wrong."
302314,Try this place for its best Boondi ka Laddoos..... I bet you won't get this good BKL on complete IGNOU road .....except J block Market Saket.
302314,"Well it's a sweet shop!!! You get get freshest paneer!!! N Rasmalai are best!!! The best part about this shop is that on a summer u can also hit for lassi, not sure if its all year round.  :) hheheehe!! Isn't this too much mapping!"
18203159,"Guys I was not able to decide between the 2 paneer dishes I had ordered, both were same in taste. Pocket friendly place. Can be eaten in case of hole in pocket."
18203159,food is just good but not in taste
18203159,It's been almost 2 hours since I've placed my order. It hasn't been deliverd yet it's not even 1 km away but they're taking soo much time!! Not good
18203159,Thanks
18203159,without salt
302318,"I love Jalebi too much but after took Jalebi from this shop I am hating this place, worst feeling for sweets. Waste of money, if u love sweets don't choose this place"
302318,"I must be out of my mind to take a pain to review this one. One of the most pathetic sweet shop I have ever come across. Stale food, un-hygenic and unworthy of even a shop. They keep their bread pakora and samosa material for days. Yuk! They should have raid by a food inspector for providing such a low class food (or should I call food?)."
302311,must try pastries too good in taste and designs for cakes are just awesome Cheers to Pastry Place
18469965,"A cozy blue interior, Tall trees, Fairy lights, amazing food on the table and the your favourite people aground. This is my idea of a perfect evening. Well this place did not let me down on anything. Was my first visit here. The best pan -Asian cuisine. I ordered bao and chicken dimsums. The sauces were all amazing. That is what made the taste even better. Do try their bubble coffee. Would definitely recommend this place if you are planning to go to Champa Gali."
18469965,"Pho King in Champa Gali, Saket serves Pan Asian Food with some other international options like Mexican and American.  In the picture: Crispy Corn Shell Tacos with Pulled Pork and some pickled veggies like Capsicum, Onions and Cabbage topped with a bit of Gaucamole; Sour Cream and Salsa came as sides. I found the pork to be quite bland and also the quantity was a bit unsatisfactory. @phokingindia  Rating:‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èüí´   Chilli Garlic Chicken Noodles contrary to the previous dish, this one came in a better quantity, the veggies were fresh and well sauted and so was the chicken but the Chilli garlic factor was highly questionable as I couldn‚Äôt taste either very prominently.  Rating:‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è   In the picture: Bahn Bao with Teriyaki Chicken, these were homemade style steamed buns with pickled carrot and cucumber on a base of teriyaki chicken chunks, lettuce and kimchi with hoisen and chilli mayo.  @phokingindia  Rating:‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èüí´"
18469965,Dim sum are must try . Love there blue decor.
18408066,I m not sure why are they registered with Zomato.. I tried calling multiple times...But never got a reply from them.. Didn't bother to answer the call.
18408066,"Completely unprofessional business, delivery person not showing up even after 2 hours (commitment time of 45 mins). On calling these people, they ask us to pick it up from their store, in an unapologetic tone. I am sure meat will taste same everywhere, it's your service that matters."
18355141,One of the best biriyanis in neb sarai area good quality rice juicy and tender chicken and good aroma and quantity love this place helped me survive in delhi. for internship. Price is 180/kilo
18355141,Ignou road has some of the best biriyani in south Delhi and it's not easy for a biriyani stall to survive here without selling something good. This place looks run down but the biriyani is nothing you will complain about. Great muradabadi biriyani at a very low price point.
18408037,Its new family restaurent near my house so i was quite exciting about it. We tried and give an order for home delievery for kadhai paneer and mix veg stuffed naan...in simple word it was waoo.....me and husband we both liked its food....plus price are also reasonable......for food i can give them 5 out of 5....they r working on their interior so when i went their it was not fully prepared....but what all we need is good food @good price...so worth trying this...
18312586,To be very honest Mohit Bakery place is not the best place. If you are on budget then i guess this is the best place. Cakes are average looking and taste is also average. They can improve their food quality. ‚ñ™Ô∏éfruit cake ‚ñ™Ô∏échocolate cake
18312586,"They have nice cake, pastries and other sweets. Small shop with so many varieties and quality, which is rare combination but here you will get both and price is also very low."
18312586,"It's a small outlet settled in the streets of Sehdulajab Village area near about saket metro.  But i must say, it maintains its quality n is pocket friendly as well.  For couple of times i have ordered caked from them and quite a few times had snax. They always delivered freshly baked cakes and the patties, burgers n pizzas were nice every time i ate.  I really liked their Mango Cake having rich amount of mango fruit in the middle and layers of dry sweet mangoes (aam patti) in between.  The fresh fruit has been my favorite too, the layers of different jellies stacked over each base and fruits on the top. It was amazing to eat.  They also deliver within some 2-3km with nominal delivery charges but for cakes you must give them order in at least 3hr advance so that they may prepare it specially for you or folks can buy form the regular favors too."
18312586,This is a very small bakery at Sadulajab. Almost everything what they offer is yummy. Very Very economic.  I personally like their veg/non-veg Sandwichs and a special shotout to chocolate truffle cake.
18440160,"Owner do not know how to talk to customer. Beware ZOMATO gold customers, they are giving quarter dish if you order half and when you tell them that it‚Äôs quarter they have best answer -‚Äúwe have talked to zomato and if you want half directly order from us‚Äù"
305833,"My mom ordered 2 of their donuts, they were so bad in taste. They were totally tasteless!! I would never buy from them again, the chocolate one was more worst, the vanilla one was bearable."
305833,"Must try KitKat donuts Chocolate gazed  Quality : 4/5 Ambience :3/5 Service:3/5  Best doughnuts in town , tasted rightly sugared & spongy.  The original glazed is a must try and one of my favorites   Looking forward for more  new flavour.  Will visit again"
4830,The ambiance was quite nice and was less crowded maybe because of its location. The noodles and chicken were quite authentic Chinese and was tasty. The place gave a sense of real Chinese authenticity. Overall experience was good.
4830,"Awesome food and super economical! We ordered sizzler, 1 appetiser and 2 mains and the bill was under 2K. Must try Sizzler during their winter sizzler offer.... I will recommend to my family and friends."
4830,Suraj is a great personality and has great hospitality skills.
4830,Great food.. excellent service by suraj
4830,Suraj has good hospitality skills.
9984,"I have been a Starbucks customer for years. The steadfastness of their quality service and coffee is second to none. The proof of their standards is the years and years of proven service and ""customer-first"" attitude. They get my money because they deserve it. Period."
9984,Love the variety in cakes. I love how delicate and delicious the cakes are. Enjoyed the experience.
4271,"This is one of the best ice cream outlet in delhi,  situated in select city walk mall, saket.  The outlet is quite overpriced but I found it worth,  I ordered classic fondue it's full of multi flavored ice creams and fresh fruits with hot chocolate and caramel.  I love to visit again...."
4271,The ice cream tasted good But the prices are sky touching high It isn‚Äôt worth it There are better options available out there So instead of spending a thousand bucks here You can save and go to other ice cream parlours !
4271,"I'm a big fan of H√§agen-Dazs, and have tried a lot on their menu. But, the Select Citywalk outlet has a simply terrible service. I had very poor experiences last two times I visited. Last time, I ordered a Classic Fondue. We were the only customers inside when we placed the order. The guys took 20 minutes to even start preparing the order - and that too after checking on the status twice. In the end, the icecream balls which are served alongside fondue were almost melting off. Next, today the AC was not working and it was still day time, and hence very hot. When asked, one of the guys said that the AC is working at its best and they know that their is some fault in the AC. The second guy later said that the AC was slightly ineffective because of the power trip few minutes ago (which is a false claim because the AC was not effective at all even when I stepped in, and the power trip happened after I came in).¬† Both the times, I also found the people working at the store very cold and unhelpful."
4271,"An evergreen Glacier , their ice cream are rich in taste and in cream too in on word, addictive.  One of the rare Delhi's outlet. I grew up with the vanilla macadamia one but all the flavors are good, Service was nice, they could provide us some glass of water, ( in movenpick we requested them the same service But they wanted to charge for a bottle) H√§agen-Dazs ,ice cream in Esperanto"
4271,"I came here with high expectations and tried the Eiffel Tower,Belgian Waffle Dream and brownie with ice cream but I was highly disappointed. The quantity is less and taste of the desserts is below average. The place is not all worth the money they charge."
4752,"Well Maybe our last visit here.. confused staff, average food ... bad sheesha... inconsistent DJ, and failed to provide chilled beer ... only had premium KF ... very limited (depleted i should say ) bar menu ... we ordered snacks and after 20 min we get to know - not available...   Well  - AVOID"
4752,"The entrance is simple and vast, not narrow like many lounges. You would lay your eyes on the bar as¬†soon as you enter with seating on the left and the right. The dance floor is also on the left with the DJ at the far end. The place looked better than the last time I went. An intense musk aroma hangs in the air that does a lot to add up to the ambience of the place."
4752,"We had done Lenskart party today here & we get to know that lighthouse have worst service in terms of Liquor, in terms of food & even there employees are worst.. if you want my opinion then they can't serve a party seriously.  If you're going to visit lighthouse 13 then think twice. I'll never visit here again in my whole life worst & pathetic service in all terms apart from DJ...."
4752,Worst place ever! Don't even go if it is the last option. FYI they served all of us in plastic glasses and the food was also‚Äã pathetic in taste.
4752,"So my friend gave his birthday bash here Nd it was memorable bcoz of the music, DJ, interiors and somewhat food. I had chilly panner in snacks which was not so good and kadai paneer was totally onions and lots of it"
4341,"One of the tastiest galouti and seekh kebabs in the city, the Great kebab factory is bound to leave you with an tendency of having overshot your appetite.the service is on point and the breads are also amazing. Honestly I have never reached the main course level of this place with a lot of appetite because the starters are so amazing."
4341,Great place to visit for buffet limited items but taste was good.  Although service was not upto the mark.  But interior and taste was fine.
4341,Great food and service. !!
7364,This is original khan chacha. Chicken korma was super delicious. Mutton n chicken rolls were ok. Haleem was also good. Its is too crowded and we had to wait for table. Its area is also small. Ambience is average.
7364,this is best delivery outlet and famous in saket.  Ordered their mutton tikka and kakori kebab roll along with mutton biryani. Food is decent and service is quick
18219554,This one of the best mocha coffee i have ever had. I just loved this place. Being a coffee lover it's was nice to visit this place and enjoy the cup of coffee over there.
18219554,The banana pancakes was very nice. Also the hygiene was up to the mark. I really liked the interior and seating space. Hope to visit again soon..‚ù§Ô∏è #foodie#foodlove#foodporn#foodphotography#foodart#foodforthought
18219554,The shop was really eye catching ‚ù§The coffee shop serves best coffee. I ordered coffee and snacks. Food was also delicious üòã
18219554,Liked the half n half pizza concept. Picked Provencial (Veg) and Piccante (Non veg; Pepperoni). Really tasty except there should have been flavoured oils or some sauces. Very cute ambiance and great music!
306545,"We got a coupon to go to this place from the movie tickets we bought for the Saket Cinema. It turned out to be pretty good! What a surprise and it was quite affordable too!  This is a great place to grab a bite once you're done with the movies.  The decor is classic bar/pub like. The staff is ok--they helped up out with the discounts etc.  The menu is your usual fast food and snacks with some interesting choices thrown in too.  For starters, we ordered stuffed mushrooms which were delicious. The Bombay Cheese Toast was also excellent.  For drinks, we had strawberry peace fizz. A very unusual¬†and tasty drink. Yum!  For the main course, we got flat bread..which was, well, flat. No taste, no oomph-nothing.  We were quite full anyway so it was ok. Maybe try something else on the menu.  This is a pretty great place overall."
306545,Its been close to an year that i have been going to this place and every time i experienced so nice and warm welcome from all the staff member and management. Specially i made a good bound with Subrat Das who help me to choose nice food and drinks all the time. I am looking forward to host some more office gathering to this place and specially in Saket harrys as its close to the place where i work. Thank you so much for all the great evening which i enjoyed the most along with my friends.
306545,Me and my friend had a really good time at this bar yesterday night.The service was very good and the staff were polite to us.I  had memorable night with my friends at this bar.
306545,"Weird as hell staffs, didn't know what's on the menu & then huge mismanagement issue happened. They didn't serve us the drink we ordered but charged on bill. We had a huge tussle with the manager as it is not our responsibility to remind them to serve our drink! Please up your game! But your food & drinks were good"
306545,"Pathetic ! Disgusting! Abysmal!  Mr. Mahesh (who is apparently the manager) needs to learn how to behave with customers if he hopes to stick around in the hospitality industry The waiters there have no clue about the menu items. The manager bills something he hasn't served us - and asks us to forcefully drink it as they've ""punched it already in the system"" Sangria is decent - don't ever go there - simple enough decision !"
8201,"unkin Donuts is my favourite place for burgers, donuts and coffee. Spicy grilled chicken burger , potato wedges and a classic dunkaccini is to die for. A wholesome tasty meal you won‚Äôt forget."
8201,I ordered 2 boxes of their 6 set donuts. The only dounut that was not as good as I wanted it to be was the one with sprinkles on it. Maybe because I like chocolate more.
8201,"Hey foodies,  Dunkin donut is my favourite place to have a choco Eclairs. Any day and any time."
8201,Best donuts in the world I'm in love with their donuts They offer such a great and wide variety of deserts Food-5/5 Hygiene-5/5 Ambience-5/5 Service -5/5
18219522,Restaurant was good however bit overpriced considering food taste
18219522,Roof top dining is excellent with good ambience.. Food quality and service is the best thing
18219522,"Nothing was good expect the ambience. We ordered pizza and chicken tikka which were average, liit which was very bad in taste, both of them, and masala peanut which we couldn‚Äôt even eat. And everything was costly. I thought of having a good experience With the food here but that didn‚Äôt happen."
18219522,"The worst kind of Caesar salad..no croutons,no cheese and worst of all there was beans and zucchini and carrots in Caesar salad...sauce was very disappointing as well!!"
18219522,"Multiple Billing Issues 1. Person downstairs offered 20% OFF on Total Bill but the waiter only gave discount on Food 2. Service Charge was added on Sub Total instead of amount after Discount 3. The waiter was unprofessional, unhappy and untrained when I mentioned I'll pay via Dineout Pay as if the amount was coming from his own pocket."
3921,An ultimate place for Chinese food lovers. I've been here many times and every time I try out a new dish. So far I've never been let down by any dish that is served in this place. The food is of top-notch quality. Its a heaven for Chinese food lover.
3921,We offered some authentic Chinese food . The items we ordered were very oily but were average to eat. I found nothing special. The place was well maintained. The ambience gave a real sense of China. Overall experience was average.
3921,This restaurant is the most irresponsible unapologetic duffers I have seen to a pure veg family this solved non-veg Jumbo Singapore Wonton noodle soup.  This restaurant has mixed up its vegetarian and nonvegetarian service areas and no one has any idea with the veterans suggesting that the food is vegetarian even when I showed him it's non-vegetarian chicken the manager was unapologetic and said we are sorry.  if you value your relation do not visit this restaurant as chefs and everyone is very unprofessional and insist that they are right
305781,"Favourite place to hangout to soothe out that post shopping exhaustion. Perfect place to sit and talk! The coffee and the cinnamon combos are a must try. For all the amazing talks I have had at this place , 5 stars!"
305781,"Best place to hog onto cinnamon rolls, shakes, bons and they serve everything so fresh that it simply melts in the mouth. We had their classic mini bons and cinnamon iced coffee and both were super good!"
1372,"I love the ambience, service and the food I mostly love the cheese cake and they served a dish named 3 egg with the slice of bread and salad, and that was damn good. Everything is amazing worth to goüòç"
1372,I love the food... Its very delicious... I love the hospitality given to me by Aditya....
1372,"Went their for the first time with office team for work outing. The place though have a wide variety of coffees/food available, but it was very compact place. The sandwich could have been better. Double hot chocolate was good. Better to find another coffee palace for a date then this place."
311634,I always have my favorite butter scotch shake and this is shake is amazing
311634,"I tried Choco berry blast,exotic mango, chocolate hazaelnut hunger shake and i truly loved it. What a taste,it is so thick in consistency Had tried many shakes but this is marvellous,delicious,that glass bottles is so cute.i love it must try guys."
311634,I really love keventers shake. It‚Äôs my all time favourite.its consistency is so thick taste super delicious. Little price but worth it. Super yummy super tasty. Summers friendüòä
311634,"As I wished to try a new Indian flavour, Rose-e-Gulkand seemed to be the right choice. Nice small outlet with a good view and a cap that you can take home as a memento.  I do miss the original price and the authenticity a bit but still a good place to visit without any doubt. Loved the classy milkshake and will surely visit again."
310916,"I love the quality of food from this place. Among other places like dominos, tossin, Pizza Hut this one also complies with good food quality practices. I strongly recommend this place."
310916,The red velvet jar which I ordered was very tasty and the pizzas here are crisp and thin. Overall experience was good .
310916,Ordering a 500 bucks Margherita pizza one expects it to be tasty with right quantity of cheese on it . But sorry u disappointed us .
219,Amazing food and on time delivery
219,Love the food to the core..
18217023,Blue Tokai is an amazing place to have a cup of coffee with your friends . The place has a very calm ambience and the aroma of coffee is all you need to lighten up your day. I loved it‚Äôs croissant ‚ù§Ô∏è
18217023,Super kind and accommodating staff even amid tough  times -- delicious and healthy salads I trust and alternative oat/nut milk options for lattes make their options unique and best in town!
18217023,"This is my go-to place with my husband for a coffee and croissant. They have the best croissants in town. Rasberry cruffin topped with white chocolate is my favourite. We have tried almost every croissant here and each and every croissant is tasty.  The ambience is really cool and pretty, specially the outdoor area.¬†  Must go to this place!!"
9720,"Been here few times just to ensure I don't write anything wrong. But after experiencing the same thing every time, below are the highlights of this outlet:  *Extremely poor service - Their staff isn't bother whether you are being served water, menu or even food. It's difficult to spot the servers and after continuous reminders, the food gets served.  *Food Quality - The way food is served here is different as compared to the other outlets. Most of the dishes have fried items made in weird smelling/tasting oil or maybe refried which leave a bad taste in mouth.  They really need to work on everything including service and food.  For more updates join me on Instagram @love_yourself_love_life"
9720,The best go to place for me considering it serves different varieties of beer and the snacks available alongside and very well prepared..the ambience is nice and has a good seating area for groups.. recommended
9720,"I love the koliwadi chicken fry here and ordered that with beer. We ordered the ajwaini fish tikka as well, but we're surprised to find the fish was not fresh. Fortunately, the restaurant replaced the dishwith chicken chili which was better. Earlier, beer cafe used to have a long menu with beers from every country, however the menu is very limited now."
2741,"It's always a pleasure to visit this place and treat my taste buds with immense flavors. Started off the meal with Som Tam which was tangy, spicy and very fresh. salmon and khao phad sod where chicken was tender and cooked to perfection and salmon was soft as ever and very well marinated and flavorful. Ended the meal with hot toffee pudding with a perfect balance of sweetness and completely melt in mouth dish with great after taste and works well even if you get a sugar rush. Definitely looking forward to visit again and try on some more delicacies and experience the lavish luxury and treatment. Staff was courteous as always."
2741,Awesome fixed menu at 1800 + taxes. Awesome experience and food. Exceptiinally fine treatment and service provided by Mr. Jugendar of Pan Asian. Full points and must visit.
2741,"I loved this place! We had dimsums and prawns for appetisers and they were delicious, as was the lamb in coriander sauce and prawns in xo sauce for main. For dessert, we chose a date pudding which we loved but the fantasy platter could've been better!"
2741,"#IMPRESSIVE   Yesterday , I visited one of the famous Chinese and Thai Restaurant in Delhi , we were four of us and opted to have the set menu , having a 4 course meal & were served by Mr Jeetendra Singh .   1) We started with appetizers which had :  ‚Ä¢ Vegetable Spring Roll - Amazing , crisp & tasty ‚Ä¢ Chongqing Vegetables - Spicy vegetables  ‚Ä¢ Veg Shanghai Dumpling - Very Ordinary Dumpling ‚Ä¢ Chingqing Tofu - Soft tofu , good taste   2) Sweet Corn Soup : the soup was quite ordinary , served in an ordinary cutlery and had a basic taste.  3) For the main course we had :  ‚Ä¢ Kaeng Phak - Green Thai curry , this was the best in the whole meal . ‚Ä¢ Stir Fried Asian greens : quite basic  ‚Ä¢ Zucchini, shitake Mushroom Tofu - Served in Black bean sauce , it has strong taste .  ‚Ä¢ Asian Mushroom Trio - Assorted mushroom in black bean sauce . Wouldn‚Äôt recommend  ‚Ä¢ Vegetable fried rice : Same as everywhere .  ‚Ä¢ Chilli Garli Noodles :these were tasty, well cooked  4) For The Dessert :  ‚Ä¢ Toffee Pudding with vanilla Ice cream : This was the best party in the whole 4 course meal , the pudding was soft , dressed with caramel , accompanied with vanila ice cream - making it a perfect thing to fill the sugar Binge .  ‚Ä¢ Fresh Fruit Platter - Quite Basic .   Overall the food was good , worth trying & we Went on a Tuesday night , so the ambience was ok-ok , while the service was quite good , Mr J Singh , served us well . A nice experience .  Price of the Set Menu : ‚Çπ 1800++ Taxes / Person"
2741,"Compliments are most definitely in order for the decor of the place; it bespeaks of thought and effort having gone into it. The staff is polite and courteous, and do their best to make you feel comfortable.  The food, however, was a bit disappointing. I tried the ramen noodle soup with chicken, and prawn tempura. To my great dismay, the soup was underseasoned, and tasted a bit like soy sauce and hot water. The flavours and textures I had expected in this dish were heartbreakingly missing. The prawn tempura was texturally sound. Along with the prawns, however, there was an array of tempura vegetables. The vegetables were perhaps not as dry as they should have been before cooking, and the moisture of the vegetables felt discordant with the crunchiness of the tempura.¬†  I was slightly unhappy with the experience of Japanese food at the restaurant. However, since I have enjoyed many a pleasant meal at other restaurants in the Sheraton, I am inclined to believe that other cuisines served at the Pan Asian would be flavourful."
7824,"A nice place to order lunch, the quality and quantity both are a decent.  Simple and tasty food at affordable price In Sarita Vihar. A good aption for desi food lovers"
7824,"Non hygienic , bad quality of food, pathetic service, shayd hi bartan dhote hoge....Na jao Bhai...waha...daal , chawal bana k kha lo..pls avoid this place."
7824,madarchood hai behn ke loode worker..owner ke na hone pr apne baap ki dukaan smjhte h customers ko thk se hndl ni krte..bs ek hi chej achi hai tawa roti milti hai baki sab bkwaas milta hai
7824,Good food at a great price is what you get here. They need to prioritise orders and maybe introduce some non veg food at some point of time. Otherwise it's a fantastic outlet.
18219530,I like this place very much because food are available at reasonable price and service is also good and the main is there is a lot of crowd to make your mood so go there and enjoy the meal .
18364414,"I had a bad experience with them. ¬†I ordered for the first time and did not get the tiffin. ¬†I was waiting for lunch till 2:30 pm (time promised for arrival was 1:00-1:30). ¬†Everytime I called, the person said, the delivery boy was on the way and will reach in 10 minutes. ¬†Finally at 2:45 pm I called and the person said I could not find the address and now I have reached my home. ¬†He neither informed me that he has cancelled the delivery nor he called even once to ask for location."
18357939,Good place for some kerala food. Food is good. Small area..but you can get nice kerala food. Not soo costly. Must try beef fry. Worth especially when you are away from your hometown
18357939,Nice South Indian food especially those kerelian dishes and the fish fry they serve for lunch is mouth watering. My weekends are sorted for sure to enhance my taste buds from the daily monotony
18357939,"I was craving for a homely kerala meal since long, after I landed in Delhi a week back. Thats when my friend took me here. I have to say its quiet a descent place to get kerala meals. The rice, sambar, rasam and all the side dishes are really good. The restaurant is Air conditioned and the tables are also neat. Food also gets served fast. They even have kerala paratha and all the combos that go along with it. If you are craving for a taste of Kerala definitely check out this place."
18357939,"One of the best South Indian(specially Kerala) food joint in South Delhi region. I had ordered Chicken biriyani and it was good. It was served with salad, kerala pappad and pickle. I tried Kerala porotto also and it was really tasty. This was my first visit so couldn't try anything else, but I would really come here again and I recommend people to try atleast once the food here. They have delivery for food above 300 and even take catering orders. I saw in the last review that the place is not hygienic but it's not so, the place is very clean and it's Air conditioned also. Enjoy the taste of South at reasonable price."
18357939,"They serve the food from Kerala. A lunch/ dinner won't burn a hole in your pocket. The taste is comparable with that of any small village restaurant in Kerala..  However, the HYGIENE is EXTREMELY POOR. The cooking and work areas really hits the bottom on the hygiene level.  Recently, they have expanded and moved to a new building. They still use the old building as a work area, say for wet grinding, cleaning the fish. By accident I wandered into this building after they have shifted. DISGUSTING. The floor is all dirty, the odd looking guy with poor personal hygiene was stirring with his two hands deep till his elbows in the wet dosa mix. The whole place stunk of rotten fish. That area is like any slum kitchen. Any honest food inspector will close this restaurant down for lack of hygiene without a second thought.  Customers of this restaurant don't care about hygiene because most of them are low income group interested in cheap Kerala style food like beef, fish, tapioca. They are interested in 'Kerala food', not 'good food'.  FOR THE LOVE OF YOUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM, STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT"
18425158,"Chowringhee is a complete fast food house . They serve one of the finest rolls and momos in town. So recently i ordered veg gravy momos , chicken tikka roll and veg momos . So talking about the packaging.  It was very decent the aluminium packaging kept food warm and fresh . So for packaging of the food they are very specific with the things that are provided with it . They had given plates and tissue in packaging. Now talking about the food , so the taste of the food was pretty decent . The quantity and the quality both were top notch and according to the price they are completely value for money . My personal favourite were the chicken tikka roll amazing taste would recommend all to try that once . Soy over alll experience of this place was very decent. So i would recommend to order from here and try out their amazing delicacies."
18425158,"Have always heard of of chowringhee from my friends so few days back decided to try out this place..I tried some tandoori soya chaap , that was served with green spicy chutney and onion rings , was a bit oily but tasted nice ..I also tried their paneer tikka roll that was stuffed with beautifully marinated flavourful paneer pieces , tasted really nice..The outlet is worth giving a try..."
18425158,"The best place to satisfy your food cravings. Love the variety of dishes here, their amazing flavor and great quantity. The food is hygienic and freshly prepared. Elaborate menu which serves great variety of snacks and lip smacking rolls. I had Double chicken tikka roll, great taste, well cooked chicken, filling was delicious. Loved it Tandoori chaap, it was soft, perfect taste and delicious Paneer malai tikka, fresh and tasty, with tasty green chutney. Tandoori veg momos, drooling, great stuffing and tasty. Overall, I had a great experience here. Highly recommended dishes and great service. A must visit outlet."
18425158,"Now a days Winters are so freezing that you need lip smacking hot snacks in evening. That's why I ordered Tandoori Veg Momo's from Chowringhee , Sarojini Nagar. As you are clearly see in the picture Momo's look so amazing and Delicious . Momo's were amazing and well cooked . Masala on the top of it was so Chatpata that I wasn't able to control myself from eating more and more . Service was good too . They're pocket friendly as well . If you're around this place then you should definitely give it a try ."
18489497,osm
18489497,excellent
18489497,Half biryani should have atleast 5-6 pieces mine had only 3
18489497,"worst experience ever, the food was pathetic, don't ever buy food from this outlet. The food looks rotten, don't get sick from eating this food, please please don't buy from this point."
18396418,Often we order from cake spot and evey time we received value of money cake. This time only fruit cake was not so good because of some points you can see in pictures.  So at the end we love to order on cake spot thanks for making our moments memorable.
18396418,"I am giving that review on basis of wrong food deliver by them,They have posted Nice pics in Menu but they are providing another product."
18396418,Cake was stale and was delivered without the name on top of the cake which i had specially mentioned in the instructions.
18396418,Ordered a Red velvet cake for my father's B'day from this place and it was actually very yummy. The taste was so balanced and tasty that we loved it.
18396418,he was good
18425149,"This is a very economical place ,but the food is not upto the mark.Although this place serves a good quantity of food ,however the quality is a little disappointing."
18425149,"Very delicious Chinese food , I have rated 5 stars . Buy your food from the Krispy kitchen. Very delicious food at a low price .I have ordered Singapore's chowmen and planner mommos it was very good . We can also go there to eat . Thank you"
18425149,"Great noodles! Try singapore or chilli garlic noodles and chilli chicken! Good with home delivery too. Also, chilli potato and sweet corn chicken soup. Great place!"
18425149,Paneer spring roll are most favourable party of Kristy Kitchen. Served with red and Green sauce just add mouth watering in the mouth of the customer. next specialist is the veg noodle served with chilli sauce.
18425149,I ordered veg Noodles...  And let me tell it is just pathetic.  Its too sticky.  I have ordered before and everytime it was quite fine in taste.  But today ohhh god...  It just ruined my dinner.  Like seriously..??  üò†üò†üò† I do not know whether it looks sticky or not but trust me it is..
18492652,"superbly astonishing and amazing products , providing huge choices of greatness. completely different and unique taste and more importantly it's a healthy stuff..have it once and u would fall in love with the milkshakes ."
18492652,Wowww awesome taste!!!!...I really like all chocolate flavor and apart from all these things rates are too low.... Amazing product with very low price and completely hygienic..
18492652,"An amazing place with a variety of delicious shakes . It is very economic and not a burden on pocket. I wonder that still they are providing the best flavors and taste in the segment. All chocolate flavours are so yummy. My personal favorites are mint oreo, peanut butter, choco hazelnut..¬† A must try..."
1777,Great tandoori and snack items. I love the enthusiasm of the service staff.
1777,A must visit place if you are love non veg . Highly recommended üëç #thisissodelhi
1777,"Rajinder da dhaba, dhaba name is not matter the taste and quality of food is very good. In the beginning of Feb, I had Afghani chicken with very good taste...."
1777,Wow taste of mutton.
3379,One of my favourite places for Italian.
3379,"food looks terrible... who is the chef, I worked in Chinese section for 6 yrs in your hotel¬†and I moved to USA on 2012. I am working at Ritz Carlton,¬†Washington DC. The presentation of food is terrible bad I saw on your photo. if I get chance I will teach you.."
3379,I loved the wood fired pizzas. They were so crusty and crunchy. One of the best pizzas in town and the toppings were adequate to provide a wholesome taste. Keep up the great work. I‚Äôm going to be back so soon
3379,"Excellent and outstanding quality of food served at La Piazza. The stewards are kind and polite and also help in choosing truly delicious delecacies from the menu. But on the other hand, the quantity of the food was too less.  Overall, it was a great experience but the dishes are highly priced regarding the quantity of food served."
3378,Excellent Chinese food and lovely setting.
3378,"Good food and nice service. A quite place where we can enjoy our food in peace. I tried warm mashroom salad, tofu with chilli, noodles and rice. Mashroom salad was the best."
3378,Absurd delivery prices! Why should customer pay 5 Star Hotel prices for home delivery. Hyatt Regency should reduce prices by 80%
7319,"Galouti kababs so goooooodddd... We had chicken Tikka, butter chicken, kababs... Good place, amazing food quality, quick service.. this place is gonna be on my frequent visits place list..."
7319,"Chicken Barra, malai tikka are the signature orders here but very few people know that chicken curry and rara chicken is something very delicious here."
7319,"Placed an order for a dal makhani,mutton barrah and tandoori murgh.the dal makhani was really yum to have but the tandoori murgh was very badly done with salt and spices on the higher side by quite an extent.the deserts were very highly priced, almost at par with some of the vegetable dishes which i felt was way too high"
7319,"A very highly maintained 'Dhaba' where you can sit back and enjoy your meal (especially, NonVeg). You can either hang out with your friends or with family!"
4357,"So I went there for the first time with my family and it was a good experience. We went for a Sunday Lunch and ordered Butter Chicken , Rice , and Strawberry shake. Food is tasty, service is great and so as the Ambience . It was a Sunday lunch time so their was a buffet and not much options available for Ala-carte. Strawberry shake was not as tasty as expected. It costs around 6000 for 4 and that's quite reasonable for a 5 star hotel."
4357,"You must must MUST try the Nasi Goreng of Cafe. The staff is quick, attentive and very polite."
4357,"The food was incredibly bland. We ordered the Ajwain Fish Tikka and a Mutton Biryani. The Fish Tikka had no taste, and the Mutton Biryani was also quite bland. I‚Äôd recommend adding a salan with the biryani, and offering an option for those used to spicier (and hotter) food - I assure you, we exist outside of India too... The service was 5*, but the food was near unpalatable. Therefore, a 2* rating is really being generous."
4357,Food is good. I took a buffet. It was stupendous! I'll give 4 stars out of 5 because the staff made my friend sit on a dirty chair. There was a chewing gum stuck on it and it ruined her pants. Staff was not very responsive and did not help much.
4356,"I believe Hyatt Regency has the some of the best restaurants in Delhi and TK's Oriental Grill is one of them. Posh and upscale, it's a great place to hang out and enjoy your meal across the teppanyaki table. We tried the Edamame beans which is a hot favourite. Spicy minced chicken worked just fine with some chilled beer. We ordered grilled Salmon which was an absolute delicacy. Chicken teriyaki with Chef's special rice was our last order for the day and I think we over-ate. It was a pleasure to watch the chef at work and totally enjoyed the evening."
4356,Major disappointment!! Have been coming to Tk's for a while now but this kind of priceyess by the staff is unaccounted for. The restaurant was completely empty and yet we were told that the restaurant is full and there is no space. The food was below average so maybe they shouldn't act so pricey and focus on the quality of food more. The management really needs to be taught well.
4356,Excellent experience. Chef Bhuvan cooked up an amazing array of tasty food for us. Arijit our server made our lunch unforgettable. We have been regulars for years. Keep it up Team TK's!
3164,very good restaurant... also behaviour of the staff is very good.. service is fantastic.. good place to visit with family
7772,Chicken Thupka was too yummy and spicy.. i loved it. I had try this for the first time and i really loved this..good taste and quality of food.
7772,"So this was the best place where you can go for chicken steamed momo's as we like only steamed version so I can talk about that only also I do not about other stalls who serves momo's so this was the best for us it was so scrumptious and delicious we loved it, it was pocket friendly as well one can definitely go for this one and trust me you gonna like chutney was damn good. Overall executive was very nice. Ambience:-3/5, Dish:-5/5, staff:-4/5, Cost:-4/5, Hygiene:-4/5 I would definitely recommend this stall to anyone who is reading this."
7772,I was in delhi haat INA for shopping so after shopping i start feeling hungry and visited momo mia.¬† Momo mia has variety of momos in menu. Had veg momos and sweet corn soup. Momos were worth of money but sweet corn soup has disappointed me.
7772,Visited here during recent visit to INA delhi haat. Tried chicken thupka and fruit beer.¬† Chicken thupka was average in taste and it not impressed me. Fruit beer was excellent.
302542,Good amount  Taste was above average  But ambience could have been better
302542,This place is Dilli haat INA serves really fresh and good food. The quality is really good as well as the staff here is polite and helpful. The ambience is really pretty and cozy. We tried veg spring rolls here the presentation was really good and perfect as well as the taste was very good and most importantly it was served fresh. Loved the place
302542,They serve the most delicious chicken Momo's.
7768,"So going so many different stalls I. Dilli haat we decided to finish our day with sweet at bengal which didn't turn so well but it's okay, So here we order for rosogulla and sandesh I find that rosogulla was pretty nice outside of Kolkata but sandesh was total disappointment also I have already been to many different bijoli grill for which I habe uploaded the reviews as well and the main problem is they are selling everything very out there in delhi, so I wouldn't recommend this place. Staff:-4/5, Dish:-3/5, ambience:-2/5, cost:-1/5"
7768,This is located inside the delhi haat INA.¬† They have ample space for seating.¬† Had fish fry and their thali. Fish fry was excellent in taste but thali was average in taste.¬† Price is mid range.
7768,Must Visit West Bengal Food Stall Bijoli Grill For Vide Varities Of Great Bengali Vegetarian And Non Vegetarian Foods In Delhi Haat INA And Few Locations In New Delhi And Gurgaon In Haryana And Various Places Accross India
7768,"The food is pathetic and the restaurant takes a lot of time to get the order ready, the food was too oily"
7768,Amazing and fresh food. Must order the special bengali thali if you are looking to try authentic bengali food.. the staff was very polite too.
302264,Nice and authentic misal pav. Similar in taste with maharashtra
302264,I am not satisfied that much and I don't like the service but food is good so I hope whenever I come you improve your restaurant .
302264,A great place to eat and have a snack while chit chatting with your loved ones. Coffee is fantastic and must be tried. Food tastes good and sitting is open so a warm or humid weather may spoil your mood üòë
302264,Dilli haat has my heart cause I belong from Bombay and maharashtrian food is what I crave in Delhi. I came across this Maharashtra food stall and tears fell off my eyes to see VADA PAV. It had authentic maharashtrian flavour and the taste was 5/5. Must visit if and try it out. It‚Äôs pocket friendly and serves you good quantity.
309140,The service was not good and fast. The waiter was too late to take the order. I ordered Farm House Pizza and Oreo Shake. Pizza was good but Shake was not upto the mark.
309140,"We ordered Alfredo pasta, Oreo shake, strawberry shake n veg sandwich.pasta was perfectly made n shakes were too awesome. Ambience was the best thing about this outlet.it's a must try!"
309140,Good place to hangout with friends. Have been there a couple of times and have never been disappointed with the food and the service. Most of the time it is crowded.
309140,#horrible
18336489,"Off campus has been a go-to place for me and my friends most of the times that we meet. Beautiful ambience, cozy atmosphere and an amazing rooftop to blow our minds. Most importantly, they serve scrumptious food which attracts us to the cafe every now and then and we've tried most of the items be it chilli mushroom, chilli chicken, chicken tikka, pasta and what not. #offcampus #foodie #satyaniketan"
18336489,"We ordered fresh lime, iced teas and italian smooch.  For starters we had honey chilli potato which could have been a little crispier.  The dal makhni and butter naan were scrumptious though.  We ordered brownie and ice cream as a dessert which turned out to be a mistake as the brownies were so dry."
18336489,Nice place and like zomato rider ramesh kumar service
18245295,This is an amazing cafe i have celebrated my last bday here....the staff is so polite....ambience is soo gooodd....and the foood is amzinggg ....good music system
18245295,"They have music to dance spacious . Food is good but needs improvement. As satya niketan is famous for bars and cafes this place can be rated as average. I went on a birthday party with my friends. This place might be good,but when I went there that is on a birthday party the dj was not working and there was dim light. Thanks to the good company wr had otherwise the place would have ruined my friend's birthday."
18245295,"Satyaniketan as we all it is famous for their cafes and uptown is one of them ,providing a very good quality food with reasonable prices , the pizza was so tasty that i am planning to visit again thereüòç"
18245295,I loved this place & it is super affordable on the same time food is good too & quantity is enough according to the prices. I celebrated my birthday there & it was actual fun.
18245295,Uptown Cafe is a nice place to hang out with your friends. I went here with my whole team to celebrate event success. We ordered so many dishes along with hookaah. We enjoyed a lot and cafe was decent enough and served scrumptious food. Overall it's a nice place and also a pocket friendly place.
18252412,Loved this place so much . Chota packet bada dhamaka. Best place to have a good time with friends with pocket friendly menu.
18252412,"Backbenchers is a cute little cafe in satyaniketan.. Overall, its a nice cafe but it's quite small.. You cannot go their with your big gang..when I went to this cafe the best part was they didnt add any extra charges and their menu was very much affordable.."
18252412,well organised place and as well as staff quite clean and food is mouth watering worth going thier for weekend vibe and nice place to hangout with friends
18252412,Hot abd sour soup. Here the secret is the vegetables well mixed inside the soup. which becomes heavy and fulfilling to take. Well serves with sauce.
18252412,"Visited this cafe somedays back while I went to satyaniketan. The Ambience was good but I found the food okayish. We had Farmhouse pizza, white sauce pasta and virgin mojito. White sauce wasn't properly cooked and the topping was very less. Farmhouse pizza was a thin crust one and was good."
351,"Veg paneer roll, chicken roll or egg roll are amazing in taste. Tried their steamed momos, tandoori momos also. Pocket friendly rates and its value for money. Very delicious rolls and momos they have. Ordered for team parties too. Highly recommended:)"
351,"This is place in a small lane in satya niketan on your left when you enter. They serve delicious rolls and the staff is very cooperative if you want to make changes to your roll. Cheap, student friendly and really yummy. They offer discounts to freshers! Chicken tikka roll-10/10 Chilly paneer roll-9.5/10"
351,Zomato shows more higher prices than the actual prices there is atleast 90 rs. Difference between zomato price and actual price . Not satisfied with it
351,very nice food and specially dal makhni n chicken rolls are admirable fast service with affordable prices you need to try because nice taste
351,Yummy rolls and momos. Tandoori momos are worth value and rolls are phenomenal. No wonder they are so popular among students from ages. Rolls start from as cheap as ‚Çπ40 and are stomach filling. Must have and highly recommend.
18433610,"Even though the place is very pretty, the ambience is very beautiful, the servers are very helpful and polite, the food here is not upto the mark. We tried Pasta, Hot Chocolate and Waffles here, and each dish disappointed us. Not a single one was upto the mark. Will never come here again! Wish they would improve the food since the rest of the things are perfect, except for the most important one. Food!"
18433610,"This place is easy to find and is really good. The staff is attentive and polite. I had Espresso Spritzer in drink which was gooood. Something different. And in food I had chicken strips which were average in taste and quantity. I had this lovely ""me"" time here."
18433610,"This cute cafe has something for everyone. Whether you want to have a conversation over coffee, play board games or simply go and read a book. ‚ò∫üìö The cosy interiors, background music along with some delicious food, makes it one of our favourite places in Satya Niketan üíñ"
18433610,"One of my favourite places in satya niketan! You can hang out here for the longest time because of the games it has, the books and the very tasty food it offers! Loved everything I tried :)"
18433610,"DISH NAME- VEG SAMOSEK LEBANESE .THIS DISH WAS DROOLING... DISH NAME - HUMUS PITA , CAN GO FOR A NICE BREAKFAST ...

18358164,"It is a small compact two floored cafe with dj food is ok interior of cafe is very beautiful,for proper lighting go for second floor"
18358164,"The place has some insane music to keep your feets moving. The food is also amazing. Chicken lollipop, chilli potato were amazing. The mocktails and staff behaviour were also good.I would highly recommend this place to all the foodies visiting Hauz khaz. Cheers."
18358164,"Punter house is one of the many cafes in the student friendly area of Satya Niketan. The ambience of this place is pretty good. Went to this place for party with friends. We ordered 1. Crispy corn: this was my favorite out of all the dishes we ordered. It was full of flavors. 2. Chilly paneer pizza: the pizza was good, it was quite cheesy. The base was crispy and the topping was also good. 3. Tandoori momos: I love momos, but this was not upto the mark. The filling was very normal and not good for the cafe standards.  4. Red sauce pasta: pasta never dissappoints, it was well cooked with tasty gravy.  Bonus point for having zomato gold ü•á, which makes the outlet even more affordable."
18358164,"PUNTER HOUSE ‚ù§Ô∏è This place is located near south campus metro station . It has great ambience and especially dj with quite good playlist . The service is lit bit slow but place is budget friendly. Talking about food we ordered white sauce pasta ,panner tikka , virgin mojito, chocolate brownie shake and honey chilly potato .Food is quite average in taste. For more reviews follow me on instagram @_thefoodassignment_"
18157395,"Crazy kitchen  This place is located in satya niketan. It has rooftop lounge , dance floor and the ambience is so colourful and catchy. This place have great seating area with pocket friendly budget.  Coming to their food.They have great varieties in different cuisines. We ordered veg manchurian with noodles ,white sauce pasta ,chicken pizza ,tandori chicken ,chilly chicken , virgin mojito. Food was good in taste. Overall i had a good experiences here .

18157395,One of the best rooftop lounge.. nice ambiance.. nice crowd.. music was awesome.. perfect rooftop view.. best place to hangout with friends.. must visit placeüòãü•∞ food was goodüòãü•∞
18157395,Searching a great cafe with a great seating area and attractive ambiance? Then trust me crazy kitchen is the place to look for. This cafe is among one of the most popular cafes in satyaniketan. The ambiance is really really great. The attractive and eye-catchy wall decors all over the place really took my heart. The design and theme of decoration is really superb and the lighting you get at this place is top notch which really makes your time at crazy kitchen memorable. Talking about food we had here: In new additions we tried peri peri sauce chicken and peri peri sauce momos. ‚ù§Ô∏è Both the dishes were great and the presentation was also good. Then we tried the most constant dish at this place which is the chiken parantha. The taste was as good as always and really enjoyed each and every bit of it. ‚ù§Ô∏è Also got my hands on creamy chilli chicken and some hot drums of heaven with my favourite coke. ‚ù§Ô∏è The food at this place is the best among all the cafe I tried in satyaniketan. The best part is the rooftop ambiance which is the real USP of this place.  What i love about this place is that they serve complimentary sheesha if you want on a certain bill amount due to which this place becomes a great one to spend time with your gang. Overall experience at crazy kitchen is really superb and I personally visit this place often. So do try this cafe and make your time memorable and special. #MustVisit #MustTry #ChickenParantha #ChilliChicken #Sheesha #Rooftop #PeriPeriChicken #DrumsOfHeaven #GreatPlace #TopNotchAmbiance
18157395,"Crazy kitchen I went there at night, a month ago. So this is the cafe with rooftop. I like the concept of sitting on floor . It's very comfortable really . Cold breeze I ordered main course Butter naan and paneer which was good. Pocket friendly cafe. Mustgo."
18157395,Celebrated a friend's birthday here. it was a nice experience. The food is good and so is the ambience.
18358675,The food is average. I have visited here couple of times but in the starting the staff was good and friendly but as the time went and i visited again again with my group they started serving us late and the behaviour of staff towards us was not professional.
18358675,It was a good place but I didn't like the dj because I was there to do some dance so disappointed about that else the food was good.
18358675,Worst food in satya niketan
18358675,A must visit..ü§£ü§£
18261701,I ordered pasta and healthy stuff like veggie grilled sandwich the food was healthy and tasty. So i recommend you guys you can try for sure!
18261701,packing could be more better.. else tea was good :)
18261701,"Superb joint for evening knick knacks. You name it they have it. Ike burger is my favourite here coupled with a masala chai, yes omelette with chai. You will probably like this combo only here. Pasta is quite nice for you to try, the list is endless"
18261701,"The chai was delivered hot and was quite refreshing, so no complaints there. Why I give 3 stars to my experience: The Baked Nachos with Cheese was slightly singed on the sides, plus the cheese seemed a bit off, odor-wise. As for the Cheesy Fries, they weren't too bad. So, okay experience overall."
18261701,"This place in satyaniketan is one of the favorite spot of college student. Whenever you visit this place you'll see college students hanging out or doing their work. They use to have smoking area outside for all the people who like to smoke and have tea but it's prohibited now.  Chai story- the thing which makes this place a lot better for me is it's ambience. This place gives a total homely vibe with a good brunch menu. Their famous cutting chai and khulhad chai are good to go for, they serve good shakes and ice tea as well. I like their Maggie and fries too. You can always hit this place whenever you are in a mood for tea and some conversation or if you are looking for a peaceful atmosphere to read your unfinished novel."
18175323,Tasty momos available with varieties... But I would say the place is a bit expensive for momos in a place like Delhi where we get cheap tasty momos everywhere
18175323,It is a very cosy place in Satya Niketan with seating for max 10-12 people. The staff is really very friendly here.The unique combination of burger and momos interested me and therefore I orgered one Veggie Moburg. It went good with coke and I liked the unique match. Would definitely have it again.
18175323,I really like momos from wow cos of their hygienic preparation. taste- 4 not so heavy on pocket. Personal fav- momos burger. totally recommend it.
18175323,"I have ordered steamed chicken momos which were gummy, soaked in water couldn‚Äôt eat..  it went completely into dustbin.. I have also ordered tandoori momos which were ok to taste but I seriously doubt the hygiene as I have a stomach ache n diarrhea after eating them... worst experience ever..."
18175323,My friend and I order takeout from this restaurant at least every other weekend.  Their chicken fried momos are delicious and generously portioned without being overpriced and the staff are friendly and efficient.  Our food has always been ready by time and the packing is nice.
301154,"Have had their best selling pizza. I tried soya pizza and mushroom pizza both were palatable, and the best thing -each was for 50 bucks, although it worth more than this. I even tried their grilled sandwich sadly it was not that good , i had their patties which was crispy and light their chocolate pastry was divine. The popularity of this place can be seen by large queues at the counter"
18391458,"It‚Äôs a village themed cafe with amazing food , hukkah and ambiance at great pocket friendly price .  There is just a con that it‚Äôs menu is very limited , this can be improved. My personal favourite was baked nachos ‚ù§Ô∏è It‚Äôs worth giving a try ."
18391458,The interior and ambience is great just like a 'kasba' and this cafe have totally followed the theme. Service is great... Great place to hangout with friends and family.... Value for moneyüëå.... We had burgers and pizzas and in drinks -Brownie shake and that was just awesomeüíûüíû..... Overall a well day spent here....‚úåüòç Will recommend this place to my friends and familyüôã‚úå.
18391458,"If you are finding a place to hang out with your friends cafe kazbaah will surely meet your expectations. Its ambiance attracts people mostly youth and food is also above average , prices are surprisingly affordable too. Nice place to hangout must visit"
18391458,"Ambience: okay not that good. Sanitation : no complains regarding that! Food : not really that tasty,  especially pasta ranges are disappointing But some of the dishes are fine.  Prices : worthy!  Service : slow service,  i must say,  not happy with it."
18391458,beautiful traditional interior with good quality food ü•ò the only thing they have to work on is the variety of food because there are very limited food items
313296,"Bad service, ""uncooked food"" also the cafe smells very bad. Washroom is pathetic. Food was horrible. Won't recommend. Go to frdzone instead or any other cafe of Satya niketan"
313296,"Hideous cafe, this place had nothing at all in terms of an experience. The food couldn't be any worse. The ambience, there wasn't any to talk about and there was no one except us still they managed to ruin the food."
313296,"Awesome interior, amazing food. Value for moneyüòä Ordered a butter chicken masala, Hyderabadi chicken biryani and a naan. It was just awesome üòÄ A must visit place to visit with family and friends. Service and quality of food is very good."
313296,As we entered on a Monday evening this place was absolutely empty. Therefore I do not understand that the waiter was insisting on us sitting on a different table then we choose. (No reservation sign). I'm giving low score for customer service.
313296,"This place is one of the good place you can visit in whole of the Satyaniketan. The ambiance is very pleasing and warm hugging. Music in background provides perfect environment for spending time with special ones and friends. I tried out their- ‚Ä¢Dahi Kebab - They were good to have, filled in with fresh hung curd and the flavours were on point. ‚Ä¢NHC Spl. Pizza - This is one of their special menu dish, which you must try if you are visiting it. The cheesy pizza was absolutely worth every penny. ‚Ä¢Cheese Nachos - Hell of the loaded nachos all with right amount of stuffings and cheese were good to have. ‚Ä¢Virgin Mojito - The most optimum drink you can have anywhere and you can ever decide the whole lot of their drinks menu with a single drink, Virgin Mojito. ‚Ä¢Brownie Shake - Being a chocolaty shake lover, I never fail to try shakes anywhere. This one was brilliant and quite thick as it should be. All of them were nicely prepared and price is quite affordable too."
1018,One of the few places in Noida which offers a fine dining experience as offered by this restaurant. The ambience is nice and menu tempting. Both the starters and the main course offers good choices and the Liquor section although have limited choices but the serving is nice. Visit here to satisfy  the Chinese taste buds of your mouth.Price for a meal for two without drinks are approx Rs.1000.
1018,I'd say this place is an institute of Delhi now. Old as hell and there no dip in quality. They have upped their game with their new high tech menus. As a kid I always wanted a menu in which I could see all the dishes before I order anything. One of the best family restaurants for Chinese in Delhi.
1018,"Been to this place a couple of time.  Food - loved noodles n my hubby loved prawn dishes. We ordered Duck as well, wasn't that great.   Ambience - very nice n like little china Service - very good   Price - decent enough for the quality of food they serve  If u love chinese food then its a must visit . Cheers!"
1018,"One of the best restaurants serving near to authentic Chinese üà∂ food. Quality is a constant across locations and geography. A must visit place. The only thing which keeps a star ‚≠ê away though is the price. It's a bit overpriced considering the food, portion size, ambience and customer service."
1018,The ambience is pretty good and the food is mind blowing and authentic. Have been there many times and it has never disappointed me. Singapore Chilli Prawns and Drums of heaven are worth trying!!!!
309844,Would recommend to improve watermelon ice cream
309844,Best ice cream üç® ...I ordered through Zomato..the ice cream was superb..Thank you guys .Keep your good work going..Especially thanks to Ms.Minakshi and Mr.Dinesh for resolving the query and thanks for the prompt service ..Thanks
309844,"This place is my all time go when I crave for something sweet , This place offer natural taste of fresh fruits ..  I just love their jamun ice cream that is Soo delicious ...."
305303,The Chinese platter was good.
305303,This place I love thier chole batture and the chaats and also the Desserts .. I would recommend my friends the same
305303,Wonderful to see bikanerwala in gk2... now for sweets and namkeens we can't opt for more.
305303,I ordered 3 plates of golgappa but I got very very littel water for it which was not sufficient even for 1 plate of it very poor
305303,Food always yummy..  however incomplete without DahiBhallaPapdi...   N always remember.. Parking space right in front of Bikanervala is for ppl visiting Bikanervala..  so check first there before u park in paid parking..    go for window seat on floor 1. Then njoy yummy food with lots of poses u may witness..  just have to look down at Parking.  Make sure u gonna take care of ur partner as well..  üòãüòçüï∫
1021,Didn't like their service but the cakes quality and presentation is amazing!!
1021,Petty good shop in GK 2 .... Very beautiful ambience...‚ù£Ô∏è
1021,I recently bought a few cookies from this place. Totally worth it! I specifically loved the choco chip cookies and the pistachio ones.
309815,The noodles that we ordered was spoilt..
309815,The chicken in chilli chicken bites was absolutely stale. Threw it all away. Complete waste of money. I never give bad reviews but I had to this time.
310342,This place SUCKS!  It serves frozen foods with rotten chicken.  The taste is not at all good.  The waiters did a big mistake by serving non veg to my vegetarian friend.  The specialities in the menu seems to be the worst food I have ever had  A simple Soup are also seems to be not fresh.
310342,"I went with my friends for lunch, they have huge place to party or to have fun, decent ambiance with 2floor space both floor they have bar counters. We ordered some drinks (Sangrias and beer) and some main courses, we ordered mix sauce pasta, which tastes one of best I have tried, brilliant with some garlic breads, grilled fish (basa fish) served fresh veggies and butter sauce also tastes good. Overall tastes were really good food, go for Sangrias (preferance white wine). Good service, decent ambiance, decent amount."
310342,Basically a disco place with a large dance floor... Nice music both Desi and Videsi  Food is good and portions are big  College crowd. .. not for families  Won't be back!!! Atleasf for a while..   ;-)
310342,"Had to been to this restaurant recently, the ambience was good with friendly (not so over bothering) waitors . There was this live band playing soft music. We had pasta in arrabbiata sauce, as the name suggests it had the spiciness of chili peppers that left a good after taste in the mouth, the chicken was nice and tender and the drinks were also phenomenal. Will recommend this place if you want to laze away from the Delhi crowd on a saturday night with some good music and great food."
310342,"Nice ambience, awesome food... Located in gk Good service Well decorted indoor & outdoor seating  Good sheesha as well...  We like visit again soon..."
18462002,Delicious!! One of my go-to restaurants in Delhi!
18462002,What I ordered was spinach fatayer and what I received was some kind of deep fried spinach cutlets. This is really disappointing especially when you pick and choose a special dish you‚Äôre craving for. What‚Äôs the point of posting a picture if you‚Äôre just going to deliver whatever you feel like?
18462002,"Worst Turkish,Lebanese food I ever had in my life Seafood Soups smells like rotten egg. Half cooked Meat platter. Overall pls never visit this place ."
18462002,"Lets first talk about there ambience.  Baris is the bliss in this Delhi's busy and hectic life. It away from any kind of hustle and bustle. You will definitely take a pause here with the drag of hookah. Yeah, they serve hookah(sheesh) but that is really expensive. I am in love with the ambience of this place, especially at night. They are close to fine dining as they have really royal Arabic kind of restaurant but the thing that exclude them from other restaurants cum cafe genre is there ""rooftop"". I love how they have created an aura with bamboo seats and dim lighting. You really feel good there. Baris is my happy palace when I want to have a silent evening with me or with my pals over the smoke of hookah flavours.  Now discuss the core, The food. I have some mix reviews about there food. So I forcefully suggest everyone to try only there the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern dishes. They are master of that taste. Like there dish name as ""Hummus bin dujaj"" you love it if haven't tried Turkish cuisine. Their kabab are mouth-watering like ""tavuk kiyma kebab"". They have a drink name as ""Frozen Baris"" I have that drink every time I go down there, its really different kind of Mocktail. They have Indian cuisine too but if you are there to eat Indian please go to any Dhaba they will serve you much better in respect of taste.¬†  Visit Baris only for Turkish food.¬†  That's my review. Hazoor kha kr to dikahye."
2867,I have tried many dishes  from this place almost every dish is good and tasty. Taste and quantity both parameters are appropriate of this place.
312787,"Went to this place night with friends .. i really liked this place... everything was good at this place... food was awesome , staff is also very nice... want to visit again at this place...."
312787,"We called up the restaurant and asked to book table for 8 specifically at 'Fitoor' after confirming the music they are playing sunday night and on which the manager informed that its Bollywood night. so now we reach at the restaurant and on the entrance the manger informs us -Fitoor me private party chal rahi hai and aapki table hume ground floor pe book kari hai wo b humara he hai named CDB cafe.  when we are explained that the specifications given to us was of Fitoor which is on first floor they dint let us enter and the bouncer 'with gutka in his mouth threatened us ''side ho jao'' I have never seen such sort hospitality anywhere. Best part was when called the guy who took our booking on the call, he came with a drink glass in his hand and he was high in his own world. I would never suggest anyone for this place.  We are happy that post this we found the cafe 'The heroes bistro and bar' they made our evening great after such bad expeerience"
312787,"Best place to drop in with buddies, great ambience, good service and best food, the best sound system.Overall crazy place for entertainmentüôÉ"
312787,"Best place in GK2, Must Try Dal Makhni and The best Hookah in Town . Enjoy a lot last Saturday  #Food #Sheesha #BestSufiNight #Ambience #Place_to_be"
312787,"Amazing place for party or get together wth friends awesome music n band always ,  delicious food hukkaaah S usp  thr n best attentive n caring staff  ...  Keep it up guys all the very Best"
3611,It is a desert parlour one can visit... The place primarily offers Tripple Sundaes - Shakes - Ice-cream - Halwas ... The interiors are pretty nice and simple allowing you to walk in anytime in your shorts and T-shirt... Perhaps the only place where I like the Hot Choc Fudge after Nirulas... The crowd seems to be pretty decent ... All in all a nice place ...
3611,"Giani is one of the biggest ice cream chain in delhi ncr.¬† During recent visit i tried Hot Chocolate Fudge and Brownie Sundae. Hot Chocolate Fudge was one of the best i had tried in recent time, Brownie Sundae was average in taste."
3611,It‚Äôs always a wonderful experience whenever I step into Giani‚Äôs outlet. I love trying different flavors every time. I have tried their maximum flavors and one of my favorite is traffic jam. The taste and quality both is awesome.
309105,"Regret to give 1 star rating as there was no option to give -1! Being a regular in ordering through Zomato, trying out new dishes, almost 4 times a week, I thought of checking out this one. After 30 minutes, I get a call for replacing one of the items. The guy on the phone didn't have any clue about handling a customer rather he declared that now they will take another 45 minutes to deliver. I chose to cancel the order and opted out of this 'Chehel Pehel'!!!"
309105,"We have placed an order and without any call or any information they have cancelled the order. The service is really poor and the executive was unprofessional. And further they haven‚Äôt received the calls in the restaurant. It is not a suitable place for orders in urgent basis, they can cancel the order at any time and they don‚Äôt provide any further service."
309105,It is the best shop in greater kailash for fried and tandoori chicken the taste is very good and the quality and quantity is also very good sitting space is also very good overall I will give 10 out of 10 to the shop
309105,"I tried their north indian food sometime back. Tried their Butter Chicken, Paneer Aflatoon, Boti Khurchan and Jhumta Kukkad. The delivery was fast and the food was good. Can definitely try this again"
309105,"The food used to be good. As was the service. But now, the service is questionable at best, and the food, barely passable. The management seems to have given up. What was once a good restaurant now has servers scratching themselves in front of customers. I leave the rest to your imagination. Another decent place bites the dust!"
18089222,"Extremely slow service and average food. They also tried to place a weird condition on the gold membership saying the second dish (say, a vegetarian dish) would only be free if the first one was veg too!! Matter was resolved only when we called zomato support (and they were really prompt and helpful)"
18089222,"Sitting at the comfort of your home terrace with melodious Sufi music and a drink which suits your personality is how it feels at Cress. Prompt service and consistency in the taste of food is an add on. We ordered drums of heaven, masala corn and dahi ke kebab. I would definitely recommend this place."
18089222,Great place to have drinks and chit chat with friends. I was looking to good place like this in India and finally settled to cress Bistro. Drums of heaven is must have dish if you being there. Staff is very great and ready to help you whenever you need. Keep it up guys.
18089222,"Good cafe food(chilli potato, pizza and pasta), good desserts, angeethis to keep you warm and BYOB to render the angeethis unnecessary. Did I mention it is next door to a theka?  Nights with charming fairy lights makes this place worth a visit!"
18089222,"This was not my first visit to this place, but it was the first time I ordered main course and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all!! The Dal Makhani was perfectly cooked. Butter Chicken could have been better but still tasted well with the flavor of garlic naan. I went on a Wednesday and the live music  was a cherry on top."
308238,This place is up to mark with all varieties of pizza and beverages. I was impressed with varieties in menu. This place has no competition when it comes to taste and quality. Took away meat packing jumbo pizza. It has sumptuous and delicious taste. I enjoyed each bite of it. Every ingredients was fresh and hygienic. It was a bit spicy with sauce but I loved it. Packaging was good and eco friendly.  Rates didn't pinch my pocket much. Reasonable rates. I would recommend everyone to try this place. You won't be disappointed.
308238,Jackson height pizza is full of cheeze & fresh vegetables love their topping Stuffed garlic bread stuffing is so good & full on cheez  Packing is very good  Both the dishes delivered hot üëå Must try some more Pizza's & shakes
308238,"Their pizza are the best in town. Also Mr. Prajapati whom I have been ordering to has been very helpful in the delivery of hot and fresh pizza, every time I order."
308238,Yesterday I decided to have some very delicious and lipsmacking pizza and ordered from this very good outlet called New York Slice-Express ..had :- brooklyn heights pizza..it was really amazing..full of veggies and cheese..different flavours made me fond of this pizza....affordable rates...Delivered on time....

308238,"Whenever I crave For some Authentic and Lipsmacking Pizza, New York Slice Express Always hit me up with its varieties of Pizza Last weekend Ordered it from here!  So we har ordered:-¬†  Peri-Peri Pizza:- It was the best at its Taste! A Thin Crust Based Pizza with the Topping of Paneer Tikka, bell peppers and Paprika, topped with Inhouse Peri-Peri Sauces !!

18253111,"Finding Rustom's Cafe & Bakery was bit of a challenge for us today, but as Paulo Coelho says, "" And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it"". The Cafe is nestled inside KHOJ, International Artists' Association and one will instantly fall in love with the decor and after some time with the food served there.  Thanks for bringing in some quietness and classiness in the world of cafe business‚Äã."
18253111,"A serene, sound, comfortable place to sit and spend the entire day with great food and teas on the table ‚ù§ Food is amazing mostly because it's prepared and served with so much love and attention."
18253111,We have been ordering from this place from few months..the food quality is always good and fresh..the price is also very resonable...Will surely recommend this place for high quality stuff..
18253111,I have a sweet tooth. .and keep visit to new place to try out the dessert specially the pastry..This is one of the finest place to have mouth watering pastry ..We highly recommend this place...
18253111,Parsi chai ans cheese garlic pao is a must try. I am in love with this place. The place is done neatly and the menu has good options of Tid bits. I called for Chocolate coffee cake in the end it was the best dessert I ever had.  I will surely recommend this place to my friends and family
18279452,"The food quality of this restaurant has steadily deteriorated. To begin with I was rather delighted at discovering this place. Gradually things went downhill. Sometimes condiments were missing, at others cutlery. Then the food itself started getting worse. I decided it was too much when they sent me chicken manchow soup without salt and with too much pepper. Upon calling and telling them this they sent it again - this time without with hardly any chicken. Had to bin all four soup boxes. What a waste. I'm done with this restaurant. No more chances."
18279452,Worst Food Ever. Worst Delivery Ever. Threw the food straight into garbage after it was delivered after 2+ hours.   Don't use this restaurant.
18279452,i was in nehru place for a meeting and had already tried various places to eat earlier  which were both expensive and not very tasty food. suddenly I remembered the chinese delivery joint beijing street of vasant kunj. wud they deliver to nehru place. I checked and found they had an outlet in gk2. i didnt order anything to eat during my meeting as I ordered for delivery  nd then had it in my uber ride back home. the veg haka noodles and veg manchurian were wonderful. wish they open in gurgaon also. I have not had such good chinese food for a long time. cheers to their cook and owner. i think they get ingredients from a special place.
18279452,My mother had ordered from this place one day. The food was very good. The delivery boy who had delivered it was on time and was very courteous.  Recommended: Fried Chicken Wanton Chilly chicken  Mix meat Rice  Green Thai Curry.  You should definately order and try.
18279452,"Craving for Chinese then this place is definitely recommended for amazing and spicy Chinese. So we ordered for paneer in schezwan sauce, veg manchurian, corn fried rice, Singapore noodles and veg spring rolls. Everything was yummy and according to my taste. This place is recommended."
301435,Its a good family restaurant and a casual sining place. Its quite crowded most of the times. The preparations are good. loved filter coffee here.
301435,"Though you will find this place always crowded and a lot of noise, but the food here is good.  I had veg cheese dosa and filter coffe. To be honest Veg cheese dosa isnt that extraordinary. Sambhar and chutney preparations are authentic.  Paper dosa is something to die for. Medu vada is also seeved hot with hot sambhar.  Good family restaurant but definitely not for couples."
301435,"Recently ordered in for the all time favorite masala dosa, along with a rava idli and veg uttapam. So here's the thing, I've stayed in Hyderabad for 2 years, within which I may not have tried the best, but still really nice dosa's and uttapams over there. before I shifted to Hyderabad, the food from sagar Ratna was the best, i mean it's typically the closest south Indian touch that you can get in the northern part of the country. But now that I've had quite a lot of food from there, it isn't as authentic as it should be. But they do try to work alot on it. So hats off. And also a suggestion, please work on the rava idli, as it was not soft enough as it should be. Loveed the masala dosa and veg uttapam. Keep up the good work guys."
301435,"This thali has no fault, i tell you. This was my first time at Sagar ratna, i guess and I'm amused. All the dishes were great in it whether it's mixed veg., Paneer or dal. Even naan and lachchaa paratha were so good. Worth a try."
703,"The first thing that hits you is the beautiful ambiance..its like a pretty date..until you realise that it ends there. Even basic chinese stuff is sad. Being from mumbai, we are used to very good chinese. I wanted to play it safe and order from a branded place since I didnt know too many places in delhi. Bad choice. August moon was branded as per the pricing and small quantity, but forget exotic chinese dishes...even basic Chicken Hakka noodles was bad. We ordered 3 of the same dishes...chicken was hardly there...even a roadside joint will serve better quality...this had mostly egg. Really disappointing..and after that the waiter keep hanging on for tips. Price high...just not worth it. Any good reviews here are all by people either known to the owner or digital marketing. I personally visited the place for the food reviewed. Pls just ignore it."
703,"The place feels shabby, the service is mediocre and the food is sub par.  There are so many better options for great chinese food in the area."
703,Good restaurant ....food is decent not great ..only pro is open air sitting ...their crispy corn and chilli paneer are good ...never try Manchurian too bad ...in all a decent budget place
703,Bad bad bad. I puked after having there food. And it's not even cheap. Spring rolls stinking of some non edible stuff. Veggies used were like 3-4 days old. I swear I am not exaggerating. I survived. Good luck
703,"The experience of sitting next to a warm coal bowl warming your frozen hands in chilly winters and devouring a plate of prawn dimsums, albeit tiny ones, is unparalleled. Totally lifts up your spirits!  Their soups are yummy too, you have the option to choose from other outlets in the mall so that's an added benefit to visit. Must visit place."
312486,Pathetic taste stale and non tasty food suck!
312486,The restaurant accepted the online order but did not consider it the right thing to deliver the food. They did not even inform us that they will be unable to fulfil the order. We could not call the restaurant as either the phone number listed is invalid or they have turned their phone off. Now we are stranded with no dinner. There cannot possibly be worse service than this. O would have given zero stars but that doesn't seem to be an option.
312486,"I have got my today‚Äôs lunch from Country curries, i ordered soya achari chaap, panner tikka, Veg thaali and onion paratha, let me start with achari chaap it was very tasty it was properly cooked i loved it, panner tikka was really soft and juicy, spices were properly used.  veg thaali had almost everything and it was enough for 2 people,  i really liked the packing part, my food was warm when i received it, country curries will be my favourite outlet. Thanks for tasty experience ‚ù§Ô∏è"
312486,"Country curries is a relaxed dining catering to dishes of North Indian and mughlai origin. People who want sit,relax and enjoy their food specially families,this place is best for them. We tried their bhatti chicken,tawa chicken,afgani chicken and chicken mughlai. The chicken was well marinated in bhatti chicken and was cooked to perfection. Mughlai chicken was rich and aromatic.The curry was smooth and mouth melting. Afgani chicken was creamy and soft and tender. The challatis were thin and crispy. The quality of chicken and ingredients is superior.Each bite gives fresh taste and is delicious. Ample dips and salads are provided along. Highly recommended."
312486,"We were craving for some delicious non veg food, and thought of trying from here, it turned out to be the best decision for satisfying our cravings for delicious non veg food. We ordered chicken biryani and kadhai chicken, biryani was so perfectly blended with species and kadhai chicken was finger licking good."
18436439,"Ordered cold coffee, avocado toast, tomato soup, PAIN au chocolat, and Croque Monsieur sandwich. Boy, oh boy was this bad. The tomato soup was excellent. Very delicious and not spicy which is great. Unfortunately, the croque monsieur was weird and greasy. The ham was wayyy overcooked and the other components just did not go together. Chef needs to reevaluate how to cook that one. Tried to salvage by putting it in the tomato soup but could not eat it. Threw it away it was so bad. Also...pain au chocolat translates to ""bread with chocolate"". Y'all gave me a croissant. Not even close to the same thing. Avocado toast was replaced with mushroom toast which was also not very good, but at least the restaurant called to let me know. Please pay attention to what you are giving your customers. If one item is not good or it's old, just 86 it. Trust me, you will save WAY more money from 86ing bad foods than from having to do damage control based on bad reviews and a negative reputation. Also, please get a connection with actual French cuisine if you want to get in that business."
18436439,"Ordered capuccino, pain au chocolate and croissants, first two are barely ok but croissant was more than one day old, completely dried and not eatable at all. Called at restaurant and they close my phone call. Definitely do not buy here."
18254521,Best place to enjoy food and time
18254521,"I love having breakfast before heading for work as i have been getting an hour free in the morning and I particularly love the food from here, the wonder omelette and also the mocha is my favourite combo from here, what a delightful preparation and also so fast the service is, really cannot get any better than this.  A must have for everyone"
18254521,Coffee bond is one of the most amazing places especially the quality of the food is so excellent and also the preparation of the food is fabulous!! The ambience is so great and my favourite order is the pumpkin pizza along with a cup of cappuccino from here; makes my day indeed
18254521,"Flat white coffee and also the Monday salad with some many mushrooms sandwich is so yummy from this outlet I would simply love the food from here, the Monday salad is the best from here and also the quality is simply amazing  I would love to recommend this outlet to everyone"
18337895,"I've never visited this place, but I have order 1-2 times & the food was average. Price is very low, so you can order if you are on a budget."
18337895,The street cafe is the best place of south ex to order food from. The sandwich it provides is the best thing to have seriously. Nice quality. Feel happy to order the food from here
18337895,"Shittiest place ever to eat.¬† Close it down, the taste was horrible. The quality was horrible. Literally everything was horrible."
18337895,Organo was missing... Pizza crust was also not good..... Not good taste & quality...required lot of improvement. Zomato delivery was well on time.
18337895,There is a lot of hard work in packaging and promotions but I was really disappointed when I started eating.  I ordered spinach and corn sandwich and a tikki burger.  First: I received French fries and sandwich   The spinach in the sandwich were bitter and raw. Raw spinach?? Why?  It was the first meal of the day and not really a good start.  Fries were not good too.   May be they should invest more in the chef than marketing.   :)
311211,Well i would start of by saying the place has less and a really congested seating area... The staff is really not pleasant and not ready to listen to the customer's..unable to attend customer's and on top of it the service is too late..they actually need more workers to their place.. The food is served cold ..  Very disappointing.!!
311211,It‚Äôs an awesome place to hangout with friends.We went there for a friend‚Äôs birthday and it was good.We had Gravy Momos-2.5/5 Didn‚Äôt liked it much as there was an essence of coffee which didn‚Äôt go well with the momos. Chilli cheese toast-4/5 It was a great snack. Lemon ice tea-4.5/5 Totally worth it as it was super refreshing and tasted perfect. White sauce paste-4.5/5 The pasta was just perfect! Overall a nice place!
311211,"It was a great feeling to see Social in Def Col. But this time I tried different things. They have their own Red Wine and it's super amazing ! I always sticker to their Toxic LIIT but this time I tried their wine and it was awesome... . . . Must try : Social Wine, loaded Nachos, Ramesh Suresh  . . . Food quantity : 3/5 Food quality : 4/5 Value for money : 3/5 Ambience : 4/5  . ."
311211,Social is one of my favourite place.  Oreo mud pot shake is my favourite.  Crispy sesame honey chilli crispy fries are perfect. Perfect crisp and serving is very nice Love the ambienceüòç.
311211,"Great place, I'm here at least thrice a month. My favs, watermelon meets feta, fish tacos, Sriracha Paneer, Tennessee Wings, pulled tandoori bao's."
305,Taste was good but little pricey according to me.
305,"Ratna has become a byword for South Indian fast food. A price-friendly option for vegetarians, this chain serves the vegetarian food of Karnataka as opposed to that of¬†Tamil Nadu, which also has idlis and dosas, albeit with subtle differences in the taste. All Sagar Ratna outlets have a high degree of standardization, lightning-fast service and thali meals as well as snacks like idlis, dosas, Uttapams and Upmas. Sagar's affordable Fixed Thali is recommended for those who wish to have a full meal. Otherwise, try the Onion Rava Masala Dosa, the rice-dish-in-a-meal Bisi Bele Huli Anna and the Dahi Vadas, which are all good here. The Defence Colony and The Ashok hotel outlets are the most genteel. For the rest, don't go looking for ambience: This is a strictly functional chain and the prices are proof. Hope you'll enjoy eating food there."
305,"Most of the times when I order masala dosas , they will either send plain dosas with masala separately packed or will send just plain dosas and then you have to wait for another half n hour for them to send the right order .Inspite of being a regular client , they have maintained their reputation in delivering wrong orders ."
305,Ordered for Mysore Rava Dosa and Navratra Idli Chat. All the dishes were really delicious and truly authentic. Perfect place for light lunch.  Ambience is good with good qualtiy and quantity of delicious food.  Idli chat is a must try. The service was really good as well!  Looking forward to more meals at this place!
305,I receive half dosa And the chatnies are as cold as ice that means they are not fresh. Such a bad experience I not suggest you to pls don't order food form them they are not up to the mark. I give you -100star
556,Delivery guy was so polite. French fries were so crispy and very nicely packed. Warm and carefully delivered.
556,"Despite requesting for fresh fries and there was no crowd, we got stale and refried French fries !  Sad that they do not care for customer satisfaction"
556,Salad was not fresh alongwith all veggies lettuce leaf paneer waste of money
556,Ordered ice lemon masala and chilli chicken footlong. The experience was average as the food that I received was a bit cold. I‚Äôve been a regular customer of this place. Will try again though
451,"I think this is the best place to eat out in South Delhi .... The restaurant offers you an extravagant menu to choose from to eat .... Very centrally located and is a very spacious, which allows it to cater a sizable amount of people together.... My favourite is the Butter chicken and it's colour with Butter Naan ... In the coastal section I like the Chettinad chicken being a hard core Non vegetarian ....  The staff is very efficient - courteous and knowledgeable.... The service is prompt despite the rush and the place has a Buzz all the time which makes it a happening place to eat ... Very strongly recommend to visit ...."
451,one of my favourite indian food destination in delhi dal makhani being my utmost favourite here.¬† their sea food is also very popular.
451,"Suffocating, pathetic lettuce salad, vegetarian food very ordinary, waste of money"
18414499,I loved it here. Especially the ambiance.  Everything I ordered was so delicious especially the dessert. The cheesecake ‚ô•Ô∏è the mocktails the red wine the chicken the pasta the dahi ke choley everything was delicious... a bit spicy but delicious ‚ô•Ô∏è i would love to go again.
18414499,"The ambience of taksim is great. The indoor seating is pretty decent and outdoor is a good option to sit in a nice weather. We ordered, Palak patta milly filly chaat - It was great. Had also, chutney, masala, curd and fried spinach. Piri Piri flat bread pizza and Cheesy fries."
18414499,"i have been there last month the food was good but not worth to the price it was bit expensive,ambience was good no doubt in that overall you should visit with your friends good place to hangout üëçüòä"
18414499,"Disappointment! Yes that's actually all Ingot here! While I had heard a lot of good reviews about the place, the furniture is in raters and the food is just about average! Drinks did not have any punch at all!"
18414499,"Ambience was good, initially the music was soft, but on our request DJ played some quirky numbers. Food was good and staff was  also cooperative."
305269,"Food:¬† If you are really craving for nice french food this is the place to be. The decor is eye-catching. They keep on updating their menu depending on your reviews. Excellent place for a romantic dinner accompanied by dim lights and classy ambiance.  Drinks:¬† We ordered finger licking Chicken Bruschetta and Chicken Pesto. We reached during happy hours so got 1+1 bear. In cocktail, we ordered this lovely drink called Rositta. Food was nice. Some dishes were really good like Chicken Bruschetta while others average. In the main course we ordered Chicken Breast with morel mushroom sauce which I will say was above average. Overall the food was good.  Service: the service was good. It was as good as it should have been at a place which is having the prices on the higher end.  Music:¬† There was no music but I was glad they didn't try to do it. It helps to have a nice conversation with your partner without all that blaring, unwanted and not of your chosen music.  Value: The prices are on the higher side but the experience is worth it.  Ambiance: The real hero of the story was ambiance. It was at par with most of the restaurants I have been to. when you walk into the restaurant you get a feel of old British colonial era. The classy decor is unmatchable."
305269,BB is a classy fine-dine restaurant with beautiful flavours being served. The ambience is quiet yet elegant coupled with polite staff. Their Pizza had authentic Italian flavour. Watermelon based mock tail was icing on the cake
305269,"A favourite of mine in Defence Colony, this chic, French¬†restaurant is a delight in multiple ways.¬†  The gorgeous interiors with floral wallpaper, wooden chairs and tables and a lovely setting in general really make this a wonderful romantic place for a meal. Even with friends and family, this is one of those places where you can enjoy¬†a quiet meal in pleasant surroundings.  The menu and food match the gorgeous ambiance with some truly French and Italian delicacies done so perfectly, you feel you're actually in Europe.  For starters, I've tried their vegetarian quiche which was beyond delicious. Cheesy, soft and fresh, it just melts in your mouth. Definitely, not to be missed.  For the main course, their ricotta and pumpkin ravioli is to die for. Creamy, fresh, delicious...so is their¬†vegetarian lasagna and penne pasta with mushroom and pine nuts.¬† I would also highly recommend their Pizza Verde--with pesto sauce--freshly prepared with pine nuts and rocket leaves. Another favourite of mine, which is no longer on the menu is their stuffed ravioli with figs. I've had nothing like that anywhere else and I'm sad it is no longer there on the menu.  For dessert, their tiramisu is truly divine and has just a hint of rum and coffee without being overwhelming. The cheesecake is soft and creamy and also worth a try. They used to serve creme brulee before they changed the menu and it was one of the best in the city. Too bad it was discontinued.  The place is expensive but worth every penny. I'm waiting for this place to reopen so I can enjoy all my favourite dishes once more!"
305269,"I was very excited about ordering from Bonne Bouche - their ratings seemed high and the food looked interesting. TERRIBLE IDEA! One, the delivery was 20 mins late. Two, despite being late, the delivery was incomplete. Three, the food was cold. Not room temperature... it was ice cold. Four, I had requested extra sauce and no pepper for my pasta. Instead, I got no salt, and what tasted like undercooked eggy fluid in the name of sauce, premixed with the pasta, rendering it virtually inedible. The side of spicy mushrooms was the only silver in the gloomy grey cloud that my delayed lunch was. Six, it is now 50 mins past my original promised delivery time, and I still haven‚Äôt received my missing ginger ale. I can‚Äôt reach the restaurant - the call automatically gets redirected to Zomato. The restaurant delivery boy called me (he confirmed to me that he works at the restaurant) but refused to connect me to his manager. Horrid, HORRID experience. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."
305269,"The first impression you'll get the moment you enter this restaurant is that it's too proper. The walls have perfectly clean wallpaper, the furniture is almost Victorian, and you're just not used to having so much space to walk inside a restaurant. But if you enjoy that kind of stuff, all power to you. You'll like it here. We parked ourselves on the open terrace. We started off with an almond cappaccino, which unfortunately only sounds innovative. The turmeric and cinnamon cappaccino though was something new.  The preparations, at least the main entr√©es, were truly instaworthy. We'd ordered the Baked Broccoli Tots, pan seared salmon with rissotto and mushrooms, and a vegetarian burger with a falafel patty (I forget the name). These were delicious and filling preparations. I'm not an expert on fish but the people with me that are did appreciate the salmon a lot. And they said its rare to find good salmon, at least in Delhi.  When you see French and Italian on the list of cuisines they serve you can't expect the prices to be modest. But if you're looking for fine food and are willing to shell only a little extra, you'll find that this place doesn't hurt your pocket much."
570,We order veg platter which was really nice n taste good the quality n quantity were also good. Overall the experience was good as this is one of my fav place in South Delhi
570,"Love the place absolutely. Also, they serve best chilli chicken. Would love to visit again and again. The food and vibe of this place is amazing. The staff is very cooperative. Crowd is fairly good. Highly recommended."
570,have had there malai and kesariya kulfi at there take away outlet .was malaidaar and delicious rich indian icecream on stick..good quality ..now a regular at there kulfi joint
570,The best falooda kulfi I have ever had. Moets has set up for kulfi just outside their restaurant. It is amazingly delicious. They even deliver to nearby places and the packing is very good.a
570,went here with friends quite a good place to hang out and the food sheesha ambience of this place is also so good the people who all are working there was also gud they talk nicely and gently a good place to hang out
18306530,"Its a most happening place i ever went in weeknd,went with cousins for party. music was awsome,food was nice and ambiance was superb. Highly recommend!"
18306530,"I visited this place on Friday with 3 of my friends the place is spacious and has a nice ambience there is also decent amount of parking space available. The staff was quick and agile. My order was at my table within 15 mins as I told him to get everything together so thumbs up to that. My order was Mac and chesse with bacon, peeparoni pizza, red velvet shake and chesse cake shake. All of them were just average."
18306530,Located in nice. Food is good. Staff is a little inattentive which was the only flaw. Overall everything is nice. Good place to hangout with friends.
18306530,"Amazing food ambience and service..  Tried cold chicken salad , mutton rogan.. the interiors could be better with more ambient lights  The waiters may learn to be a bit more courteous though .."
18306530,it is located in south Delhi. it is very spacious.outdoor seating is also available.  food-4/5 service-3.5/5 music-2.5/5 palak pattachaat¬†¬† is a must try.
3568,An amazing restaurant. The food is so good and the place is cosy and comfortable.
3568,"Tiniest cockroach in the food - , small cockroach crawling everywhere on the wall , on the table inside the garlic bread basket .. in the bathroom & the best was in my vegetarian food !!"
9706,The place has amazing food combos for dine-in that one would love to try. I used to go their all the time with my friends  They are economical and a feast to your stomach. You will enjoy the pizza and the pasta all of it. I would rate this place a 3.75/5 for taste and serving
9706,For drinks we ordered Orange and Kafir Lime along with a classic cold coffee The taste of Kaif Lime was clearly missing and wasn't corrected either. The pizza was thin crust and pretty stand in its taste.  4/5- Ambience 3/5- Food Experience 4/5- Staff and service
9706,Delivery boy is not good. All broken foods.
9706,There was this problem with the hygiene.. firstly i had a hair in my avacado and tomato bruschetta and aftr showing it to the manager he apologised .. 5 minutes later again one hair in my son‚Äôs mexican bowl.. it was so awful and he apologised again and nothing else.. Will not visit or suggest this place again..  rubbish
312567,"I went tonight with a friend, expecting to relish some Kashmiri food. Instead I had a terrible experience.  Before I begin, for the sake of every reader who cares about their health and the hygiene of the food and the environment in which they eat food, PLEASE DO NOT GO EAT AT ROAD ROMEO.  We ordered chicken Biryani, dhaniya chicken korma, yakhni gosht, and rumali roti, along with some phirni.  The Biryani arrived first and we were left eating only that. We had to ask multiple times for the remaining dishes to be brought in. The Biryani was your average hyderabadi variety. The korma and yakhni were average as well. While we were eating our food, we noticed a cockroach walking on our table! We called the manager and complained and he moved us to another table. We were shocked and unsettled and asked him to make an adjustment in the bill as a goodwill gesture. Eventually we somehow ate our food, not knowing the condition of the kitchen (while imagining what it might be!) and asked for the phirni. This wasn't fresh at all, as it was completely frozen which is how phirni should never be. I couldn't have more than a bite and returned it.  When the bill arrived I saw that the manager had a refill adjusted 10% and I asked him to consider our bad food experience and extend the discount to a reasonable amount. He started ranting: first he said we usually never offer discounts (to which I replied I usually don't find cockroaches on the same table as my food at top end restaurants), then he started explaining how many times in the year he applies pesticides (!!) inside the restaurant and how the external construction is driving cockroaches to the restaurant. Not once did he try and put himself in the shocked customers' shoes to apologize and insist that a return visit would let us have a far better experience with a completely clean environment. Not once. He continued with his random explanations at which point I'd had enough and had to explain to him what a manager's reaction should be like to retain customers. I should point out that in the whole three hour period there was only one other pair of people sitting having drinks at one end, the whole restaurant was empty. On top of this the manager had no sense in reassuring customers that had just had a terrible experience.   RoadRomeo, first please fire your manager and get someone in there with some business sense who can do a better job for you. Second please ensure you run a hygienic outlet, consider where you are - all outlets in def col are top-end.  I was severely disappointed so am rating this restaurant 1.5/5, will never return."
312567,Brilliant food and decor. Loved the egg biriyani and not very high on the pocket alchohol. The ambience is also nice along with good service.
312567,"We all seem to be fascinated by Italian, Lebanese, European, Asian cuisine's of late that we forgot about the enchanting and the divine regional food offered by the heaven on earth Kashmir. When we talk about Indian food we mostly‚Äã segregate that into the North and the South. But if we could just expand our minds we would realize that there's so much more to Indian cuisine than butter chicken, Dal Makhani, Naan, Dosas, Idlis etc. And if you are one such person then you can't give this place a miss.  The only Muddling thing about this place is the name itself - Road Romeo. But with the kind of lip smacking delicacies they offer they can call themselves anything.  Ambience: The restaurant is on the first floor. It's spread horizontally almost like a passage way with Paintings adjourning the walls. You have the glass windows on one end and the bar at the other. But still it doesn't seem congested.  My rating - 4/5  Food: We began with a üêî chicken starter which was good. Since Kashmiri cuisine was almost alien to me I encouraged the elders in our group to pick the mains. So we ordered the Kashmiri Rajma, Lal Paneer and Yakhni Ghost. If I take out my Mom's home cooked rajma out of the race then these were the best rajma I had ever had. Dark red and dense. Spicy yet flavourful. I had them with rice. The Lal Paneer was also amazing. Big cubes of Paneer in a thick tomato gravy. Both the dishes were rich in flavour and I could actually make out the use of hot spices like ginger, fennel, cinnamon, cloves, Kashmiri mirch etc. But the star for me was the Yakhni. I had never tried something like that before. It had mutton pieces in a mild, thin and delicious curry prepared in yoghurt with spices. This was an authentic mouth watering dish. Went well with the Mirchi ka Paranatha and üçö rice.  My rating - 5/5  Service: The service was really good. Very humble and polite staff well versed with the dishes on the menu.  My rating - 4.5/5  Overall rating - 4.5/5 (could have given 5 but would love to see how consistent they are with the food on my next visit)  The appeal - Authentic Kashmiri cuisine. Must try - Yakhni with rice/Mirchi Ka Parantha, Rajma with Rice  My suggestions : None. Everything is on the dot."
312567,"Known for their scrumptious mouth watering mutton roganjosh, Road Romeo is not so packed in otherwise crowded def col. if you really enjoy eating and drinking without having to wait to get a table, this is the right place for you. Had a pitcher of bira white. Good place!"
312567,In the heart of Defense colony lies this cafe and bar. We expected better from the photos here on zomato but it was all very dull. They have two floors and can be booked for parties. Restro area was nothing fancy just some props on the walls but the service was very slow. We were seating alone but everything took around 20 minutes. Hukkah was not that good. Veg platter was a waste of money. Not very tasty but it was innovative. Chicken wings I think were delicious. Oreo shake was alright nothing great. Honey Chilli Potato were good and crispy. They really need to work on their service and food taste. They have happy hours on drinks. A bit on a higher side of the price limit but it was nothing I would visit again.
311690,"You should probably just change your name to Mr. Disgusting.  You don't even deserve the rating - 1. Even a negating number would be embarrassed to be associated with you.  I ordered via zomato and my food took over 2 hours to be delivered and that also an item was missing.  My order was a combo Non veg indian meal and it was cold by the time I received it. The chicken had pieces of charred bone splinters, though on second thoughts I don't think that was a bone splinter, just some gunk that doesn't belong in there. I'm just really scared to even try on the chicken tikka that's a part of the meal.  It's officially the worst money i've ever spent on food. Strike that. It's the worst money I've ever spent.  Also, your food is ridiculously over priced. Slash it down, Mr.  AND get your act together."
311690,Ghatiya..Wahiyat..Pathetic...Its all I can say...Malai Soya Chaap:- A BIG NO! especially if you come from north(Punjab/ Haryana).. AAAAAAA Thooooooo
311690,Inept delivery service. Nearly an hour late; food spilled in the bag and paper bags were wet. Wouldn't order again. And apparently I have to fill up 140 characters to finish this review. So I'll repeat: Wouldn't recommend
311690,You got to try the patiyala chicken!!!the amazingly different taste of the pizzas and pastas..and all this till 3 am in the morning..value for your money ..
311690,Amazing food... I live nearby so the delivery time. Is good. All in all I loved it. Keep up the good work guys!! But yes I want to put forth the delivery time as too good.
309161,"So went to this place a month ago.As I was going through the menu I noticed Mutton dak Bunglow the name was interesting so I ordered it .It was a good dish but nobody was able to explain me the reason behind it's name.Rohu Kalia is also a tasty dish which goes surprisingly good with Luchi.I had it delivered and made the luchi at home,you can do the same if you don't want to pay 80 bucks for luchi."
309161,"Good ambience.  Tried the egg thali in lunch; comfort food indeed. Dal, jhurjhure bhaja, gobi alu sabzi and 2 eggs in curry. The tomato chatni wasn't sweet"
309161,"Food: Honestly speaking the food was very tasteless. Begun bhaja was hard, moong dal was so thin and watery, rohu sorshe was also tasteless. The only dish which was good is rohu kalia but it was too spicy. The quantity was very good. Daal, aloo jhuri was sufficient enough for four person. Ambience: Bengali culture themed inside with soft and melodious Bengali signature background music. Service: Friendly and courteous staff. Very helpful."
309161,"Being a bengali and visiting a bengali authentic restaurant at New Delhi was a delicious experience!! Located at CR Park this small place is wonderfully decked up for visitors.  Food: for Starters ordered one Basa Fish Fry was crisp and served with kashundi (mustard sauce). Then ordered 3 thali of each Fish, Chicken and Mutton. Each thali was decked up with rice, Aloo Bhaja (slit potato fries), Musur Daal, Aloo Fulkopi and Tometo Chatni! Also ordered Aloo Posto (potato with poppy seeds gravy) and Beguni of peices (bringal fritters). All in this glory of table gala of food we all were full and highly delighted.  P.S check the daal offered may be a little salty which 2 of the tables pointed out!  Price and Service : price was apt with the quality offered on the table and service was also good by the minimum people present to attend the same. The waiter did hear out the salt issue and attended the same.  Ambience was also bengali feel with beautiful painted wall and the Jharbati (Chandelier) hung up."
309161,"Found this amazing outlet while hanging out with my friends. . Had amazing dine in experience and tasted droolworthy bengali dishes. . The food was authentic and had great taste, it was pocket friendly and freshly prepared as well. . Some of the dishes we tried: Cholar daal Misti doi Potol posto Chicken kosha Daab chingri . It is a must try for all the food lovers. Highly recommended ü•∞"
7636,"A famous cutlet shop in CR Park Market 2, serves both veg and non veg cutlets, though I had both of them but I found mocha chop made from lotus flower and onion bhajias really good. Fish cutlet was average though!"
7636,"Tried these uberly famous Chicken and mutton cutlets (chops) from Dadu‚Äôs cutlet shop which is a very old and popular Bengali eatery in Chittranjan Park, Market 2. Since we are used to having light and fresh cutlets in north india, i found these to be really oily (fried in Mustard oil) with a salty taste in the chicken and mutton. The chutney and salad also did not taste very fresh."
7636,"The dalpuri is fantastic. Served with not so spicy alu chole, and at a moderate rate. In evening you can find here the traditional bengali snacks like mochar chop, dimer devil and others. Food for value."
7636,Good Bengali snacks ( chop cutlet) at nominal rates
4299,"I ordered 3 Walnut tarts yesterday. There were 2 Walnut tarts and 1 peanut tart. This has happened for the 2nd time. If you are falling short of the order, why do you suppliment it with what you like. Why can't you call me up and find out what I would likeüò°üò°üò°üò°"
4299,Red velvet pastry was too bad in taste. Literally vomited  & stomach upset.
4299,"I ordered pineapple cake for my father's birthday and it was stale, I would not recommend anyone to order cake from this bakery.  WORST EVER  Spoiling memories"
4299,Had Bought Belgian Evasion Cake. The Cake Was Stale. Had Bad Odour Too. Pathetic Experience. Had Registered A Complaint On There Mail No Response Was Received.
18304836,"These guys have done some amazing job by revamping the entire barren place.  I remember going there and sitting in the open space to enjoy rajma chawal.  A beautiful place to enjoy with you date and great mix of alcohol. They also have love music from Monday to Saturday,  so you can enjoy that.    Food isn't something which is spectacular in fact at times it tastes very kiddish.  The last one I had was palak patta chat,  which was simply a disappointment but galaoti kebab was to die for."
18304836,"Not too great. Looked interesting from the pics. They don't allow alcohol in the outdoor seating area. They have live music there, which actually is more of a comedy act. That too turns lame after a while. It is also loud to the point where you can't talk to the person sitting next to you. The peanut masala and chilli paneer were the saving grace. Not going there again."
18304836,"This is legitimately the worst place ever. There are no food pictures because the food never arrived. The service was ludicrous, and so ill behaved. Apparently the coal needs an hour to heat so the pita and hummus couldn't arrive. But it took them forty minutes to inform us that the order couldn't arrive. We asked to see the manager but the server canceled our order. And this place needs an inspection by the health and sanitation department, I don't want so much dhaba vibes that there are lizards on the wall. And what is up with the sad Atif Aslam on loop. Worst place ever, man ! Worst!"
18304836,One of my most favourite place ! Perfect ambience with great supporting staff. Special shout out to Chandan for his hospitality.  Live music everyday and best sheesha in Delhi!
18304836,"This place! ‚ù§ As peppy as the name,the place offers both indoor as well as outdoor seating.Though don't get literal,they don't really have a bar as their name suggests.But those curtained seatings n pretty insta worthy setup.will make up for it. Since we weren't much hungry,this is the little menu we went for: Butter Maggi: They had only two types of veg Maggi and since veggies one is too clich√©,we went for Butter Maggi(I know I know, nothing classic there but beggars can't be choosers, right?).Anyway we asked them if they can add some cheese to it and guess what?They really gave us some shredded cheese to go with!! Yayy! The Maggi was scrumptious with bits of onion rings in it and we totally loved it.  Palak patta chaat-Ok,not so great.We have had better at the Chat wala behind Janpath.So it was a layman affair and totally avoidable.  Mojito-Too icy.Nayyy.  But then if you enter this place, you'd definitely leave with a content feeling,that's how the setup is.So ya,I liked.Food can be better though.The staff is nice, pricing is a little on the heavier side.(The cheapskate in me doesn't go for Momos for 250 bucks bruh!) So your call!"
18057805,"Ordered chicken biryani and let me tell you thr portion is ample, the aroma itself gets you hooked, the chicken was so tender , the rice was cooked to perfection and it carried the flavour of the chicken. We also requested for salan along with raita and both were exceptional.   Very biryani lover must order from here. We shall be ordering again."
18057805,"Great taste with a large variety of food and also with pocket friendly prices, a good place to go out with your mates and family."
18057805,Chicken biryani is ultimate!!
18057805,Superb option fot delivery for all Biryani Lovers.  Limited Menu with authentic Biryani. I ordered Chicken Biryani which had boneless pieces accompanied by Raita and 1 portion is sufficient for 2 people. Nicely packed and delivery was quick.
301405,"Horrendous. Eat here at your own risk. I was shocked to see one of their cooks removing soya chaap from the seekh (skewer) from the tandoor, and then used the same seekh to scrub it on a mouse loitering around his feet. Yuck!!! Enjoy your soya chaap!!"
301405,"Normally wen we go at the outlet and have it , the food is too good... I ordered soya masala chaap ND Malai chaap it was too lemony.. we cud not eat much and had to throw away.. Even the Malai chaap was lemony. Very disappointed"
301405,Its hard to find pure veg in CR PARK & i guess its the only pure veg joint in market no. 2. Tried soya malai tikka & it was too creamy & tastyüòã
301405,I have tried tandoori Chaap.. The best thing for about this place is only that they see serving veg chaap in multiple verity.. I can rate this as per quality 3 out of 5.. But 4 start overall based on taste.
3504,"If you ask me in one word to describe the chicken shawarma I ordered at this place, I would say its ""bad"". Sour minced chicken packed in some boring indian pita style bread and served with some unenticing mayo and mint chutney. Please work on your recipe!"
3504,Paneer tikka. Here the beauty is the masala well mixed in the paneer and then grilled which gives a wonderful taste.Well served with green chutney and onions
3504,"Sanjha Chulha Is My All Time Favourite Place From The Years Till Now Bcoz They Haven't Compromise With There Quality And Quanity ,I Ordered The Chicken Tikka Masala Roll And Paneer Tikka It Was Full Of Flavours And Spice As Per My Taste From Years ,Though They Have Increased The Price Of Their Food Menu But They Have Same Taste No Nevermind Ordering Again And Again From Here ."
3504,The most useless restaurant cum Dhaba of sector 19 . Faridabad . The owner is ill mannered. The delivery of the order takes 2 hours and after that the owner says I can‚Äôt help it . He doesn‚Äôt take calls and if you have guests at they would leave empty stomach . Don‚Äôt order from this useless place .
7599,"Nice bengali sweets if you are a sweet lover, loved the chamcham but advice to the management is to reduce the quantity of sugar in it and put less flavor essence in it as it kills the overall taste. At Rs 400 per kg it is a good deal!"
7599,"Fabulous sweets...specially gur er variants in winter.... Rodhogolla, kachagolla... Price on upperside..."
7599,"Had rasogollas and langcha. The sweets were cold, and hard, probably made in yesterday taken out from refrigerator. Not satisfied. couldn't finish all the sweets. Wasted."
7599,I love sweets made of milk and I am never disappointed by this place. Very fresh and perfectly sweet. Do visit for authentic Bengali sweets. Fast service and some very very delicious sweets.
4973,Ordered chicken afghani tikka and chicken shawarma. The shawarma was ok but the tikka was amazing. It is a great place if you are looking for good chicken delicacy.
4973,The worst Careless Resturant Ordered Chicken Shawarma Rolls And Given Yhe Instructions For extra Mayonnaise The Resturant Agreed But I Received Order Without Mayonnaise Packet Or Even The Shawarms Were Dry With no Mayonnaise in the rolls.  Greedy Owners Of the Resturant
4973,Tried kadhai chicken from this place. Had a priper punjabi taste with a perfect blend of spices. Really like it. Butter chicken too at this place is amazing.
7610,"I placed an order at 7:30pm (700gm boneless chicken breast). For the next hour and a half, the guy at the other end of their phone kept telling me that the delivery guy is on his way. At 9:40pm, a new guy picks up the phone and tells me there‚Äôs no such order with them, and now they won‚Äôt take any order, despite the fact that they‚Äôre still open for the next 50mins. There‚Äôs a reason this place is rated 3.3 here, and I came to know why the hard way ü§¨. Evidently, the management here couldn‚Äôt care less about how shi**y an experience their stores provide (or in this case, don‚Äôt) to their customers.  Kudos guys, for living up to your numbers!!"
7610,Very irresponsible. Kept telling that the order is on the way for one and a half hour and post that they said order has not been placed. This is very unprofessional.
7610,"This place is managed by God knows who. The rudest staff ever. I have seen the staff engrossed with mobile phone while people are waiting for them to give them their order.  Recently,I was there and one of the old, experienced staff was using cuss words, crude hindi cuss words in front of all the customers which included ladies and a child. I immediately,apprehended him and asked him not to use such words, but he didn't even pay any heed. My card had been swiped else I would have stormed out of the place!  And today, I thought of giving them Another chance, so called in for some home delivery, my order was taken and yet after 2 hrs it wasn't delivered. I called them up, the phone operator was clueless. Then. He did the unthinkable, he put me on hold and went about his business as usual. After 5 mins of holding (remember my guests are waiting in the drawing room) I kept down the phone and have promised to myself that I will never repeat my mistake."
7593,I have been there a quite a number of times. The best thing about this is that taste comes with a pocket friendly price. If you are looking for a good place to hangout under your budget then this is the place. Taste 3/5  Price 4/5 Hygiene 3/5
7593,Great service
7593,This place is not at all worth to visit... Its getting worst day by day....seems like they dont wish to continue with the shop...it used to be good lot of years back...Not at all a good place to visit now..
7639,I recently visit this place. I ordered singapore noodles and spring roll. Noodles was good in taste but I don‚Äôt like their spring roll. It is pocket friendly.  Taste 3/5
7639,hygiene was very bad.....taste was also not so good.....srsly if u r a hygienic person...then u should not try this.....although price are low but taste n quality of food was not at all good...very dissapointed üòî
7639,nice
7639,"I have known this place for quite a long time now as it is nearby my place. The food here used to be amazing and tasted so good earlier but now the quality of food has degraded to some other level. Chilly potatoes, spring rolls and fried rice are few items which used to be my personal favourite. Chilly potatoes are now overcooked and not at all crispy like one wants them to be. Also, fried rice are tasteless.  Delivery- As far as their delivery services are concerned, i would say they are pretty good.. you will get your food in time which means your food will be ordered hot which is great but be very specific with whatever you order."
7639,they took ages to deliver. I recieved my order after almost an hour and its at walking distance! moreover the man who picked up the call was very rude. I am not sure I'll be ordering from there again. Very poor service.
7584,"When you think about sweets in Delhi first name is enter in your mind is ""Bikaner"" so yeah I love to visit at this place.. .... best place for everyone"
7584,I love bikaner sweets. It is so fresh and tasty. I tried their chocolate truffle pastry it was fresh and too tasty. I will definitely recommend their pastry and sweet. It is affordable with good quality.
7584,"Had these tasty bread pakode from this outlet , they were really tasty and oily but enjoyed it ... can't wait to order again ... and rest other items... and me n my friend also tried nearby flavored ice creams ... would visit soon"
7584,"I am a Fan of Bikanerwala Chains. Its an affordable family place. me and my family like it alot. i tried their sweets . i loved their milk cake , pastry , rasgulla and rasmalai alot. food is yum..."
306531,I ordered a briyani and a honey chilli panner. My order was late an hour and didn't receive any notification from the restaurant or the delivery guy. When i called the restaurant the guy told me to take down the delivery guys no. I asked him isn't he supposed to inform me that it running that late? He said the delivery guy had loots of orders and cant call everyone individualy. I then asked him isn't the food gonna be cold he said oh no its not going to be. The delivery guy finally arrived 1hr 15mins later with cold food. They behaved ignorantly and rudely for no particular reason.
306531,No
306531,Food quality and quantity is superb. Decent taste as well.
306531,.
9095,"I ordered BOMBAY BHELPURI & SEV PURI.. and they were awesome!! Really tasty. Though the packaging of one of the items was in a brown paper bag which got a little spilled, but it was okay (not a big deal)"
9095,THE TASTE WAS GOOD ..ALSO IT IS ONE OF THE FAMOUS BHELPURI PLACE IN SOUTH DELHI
9095,Although this is a small place with no seating arrangement. But this place attracts a lot of student crowd because of its delicious food. Their Bhel Puri is good. Tried their Veg Cheese Grilled Sandwich and it was delicious. Veg Cheese Pizza was amazing too. They offer really yummy food at affordable prices. I loved it. P.S. their adjoining stall has great kitkat shake.
18358700,"Pasta la vista is amazing pasta corner they have a variety of Pasta's and Drinks. I ordered mix sauce pasta,there barbeque Grilled sandwiches and Mojito. Mix sauce is very nice it's soo creamy and full of taste, barbeque Grilled sandwiches are also amazing lots of cheese and vegetables they Mojito are quite disappointing they should improve in that"
18358700,I ordered white sauce pasta from this highly rated place and the pasta was at par with my expectations üòã it was too good üòã it's a must try üòáüòá
18358700,"Delicious pastas, burger, shakes, pizza and everything else in their menu. The only thing this place requires is sitting. Else everything is perfect and on point"
18358700,Its a small shop but with a quick and good service. Really liked the white sauce pasta and garlic bread! Will definitely visit again for a quick meal :)
310891,Foods was good . Economically. Good for Friends and families. I tried wrap... . The wrap are a must try ...‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
310891,Received pieces of hair in my veggie delite salad.
310891,Missed 70% of my instructions.
305826,I love irish coffee from your place its a must have and pocket friendly place too
305826,"Tried Cold coffee at this place. I think this was the best cold coffee, perfect taste. The place is fine, the view is good ,but I think it's a bit costly. Overall loved it."
305826,Great staff. Wanted to give a surprise to my betterhalf. Very supportive staff
305826,The ambience of this Costa Cafe outlet is the best. I love my Cappuccino and Brownie always order that. The staff is sweet and always welcome with a smile. When not Cappuccino I love to order Latte or Ice Tea with a Sandwich. Its my one of fav place
4640,"This is a great spot for vegetarian food. They have limited seating, and a lot of budget options and combos. The main draw is the quality of everything on the menu, and the hygiene standards. The owner overlooks the food being made, most of the time. You have to try the baked bean wrap, the rice and veg manchurian combo, and the potato cheese burger. They have some good black coffee too. Espresso is cheap, and fresh. This is located just outside the green park metro station, Indian oil exit. Worth it.  Note - it is an eatery, not a restaurant. Don't expect great seating options."
4640,"Hello foodies, a small cafe serving some delicious snacks and quick bites. But some time they fail to make the kind of food you love.  Food üî•üî•üî•  Ambiance üî•üî•  Service üî•üî•üî•üî•  Taste üî•üî•üî•  Value for money üí∞üí∞üí∞"
4640,A small place to eat just near Green Park metro station. Their burgers are amazing . Reasonable prices . Been here quite a few times and always satisfied with the food.
2250,Place for people looking for authentic Indian food. Good option for vegan people.
2250,I have always liked the cheese biryani here...but this time it was really disappointing...theres no green chutney and onion served with the biryani....this is really bad!
2250,I hax ordered the Paratha dish from here. The food was of good taste along with the paratha they served variety of chutneys along with curd. I enjoyed my meal here in this place it was fun and a good experience having a meal here. I liked the paratha of this place.
2250,Good service.
18427565,"Expensive place, still haven‚Äôt got my money back even though they cancelled the order"
18427565,Veg sushis were not that great. Simple decorated with vegies. The interiors and service is worth mentioning. Prettu expensive.
18427565,"Went here for my two year anniversary and loved the place. The entire ambience is very japanese, and the food is amazing. The staff is extremely professional and courteous. They also don't bother you too much. You can just call them with a bell when you need something. We ordered Asahi beer, which is really good. We also ordered yaki tori chicken, tonkotsu ramen and oh my god sushi. I loved all the food. The sushi was very good quality and creamy. The tonkotsu broth was very well balanced, though I'd have liked if the egg was soaked in soy and only half boiled. But I'm not complaining too much as it is hard to come by decent japanese in Delhi, anyway. Overall, we had a great experience."
18427565,Long queue and wait time. Even after a wait time of hours you can‚Äôt expect a better sitting place. Quite disappointed :-( . People go there for the ambience too and doesn‚Äôt expect a table near kitchen where half of the time one get a noise of cutlery and plates .
18345751,It was overly spicy! To the extent that I had to throw away the chole masala and chicken kosha!!!! Highly disappointed!!
18345751,"Today's order of the ""marrowlicious"" nalli biryani was exceptionally horrible. First, the packaging was bad and the biryani had spilt and some of it had to be wasted. Next the rice was not very well cooked and smelled stale and was extremely salty. Finally, as for the ""marrowlicious"" part of the biryani that was the biggest scam. I got two extremely short, extremely tiny pieces of bone with hardly any meat on. And to add insult to injury is the pricing of this biryani. In Delhi you can find better biryani, Kolkata or otherwise, at much cheaper prices. And when you do eat the highly priced ones you realise why you are paying such a high price for it, but this biryani is nothing like that. If you like an overpriced biryani which is the epitome of mediocrity then this is your place. Otherwise give this place a big fat PASS!"
18345751,"Ever since I read a post about this hidden gem on @lbbdelhincr , it had stayed on my mind. Finally visited it a couple of weeks back and am delighted & relieved to share that the wait was totally worth it.  Dom Dom Biryani, situated in the by lanes of south of delhi is mainly an order to deliver place with a small dining place for around 4 peeps.  If you are someone who wants to be served more than one type of biryani on the plate, this is definitely the place for you.  We ordered Yorkshire Bacon & Chicken biryani, basically a dum biryani with added goodness of potatoes, chicken, eggs and bacon served with mirchi ka salan. This was the best biryani for me till date and will surely be heading back to try their Kathal (jackfruit) and mutton biryani.  You can order online through the various platforms like zomato, swiggy, foodpanda and ubereats. But if you decide to visit the place, please call the number below as it is difficult to find the place through gps or on your own.  Address : 325 A, South ex part 2. Landmark : Behind south ex part 2 market.  Timing : 10 am - 4 pm & 6 pm - 12 pm (7 days open) Number : 8800886530, 01141086530  Cost of biryani ordered : 550 Rs.  Do order or visit soon as they have a variety of veg and non veg items on the menu but the usp is surely their biryani."
18345751,Placed an order of butter chicken with tandoori  butter roti and it was just amazing. The butter chickenwas creamy and buttery with tender and juicy  chicken pieces. The tandoori roti was also paneer andpacked nicely.  good experience overall and would love to give a tryto other dishes
301328,I ordered garlic bread sticks which was just awsome!!
301328,"I ordered Sloppy Joe's burger with bacon. The order I received didn't have any bacon in it, or any mayo in it. The tikki was stale. Hot box isn't the same it was. DON'T ORDER."
301328,Pathetic food! The pasta was stale! How can anyone dare to deliver such f uped food!! Don't order people really baf food and hygienic conditions
301328,"We ordered the family combo, which included half butter chicken, one dal makhni, 4 butter naan and one zeera rice... It's only 480 bucks... So it's absolutely great if u have to order n share between 3-4 people... The food was packed very efficiently.. And they entertained is even when we called to say we wud need disposable cutlery and they sent it! Taste wise, butter chicken was good.. Dal was tasty, but quite thick.. Naan was really good.. Overall, a good experience! Also, the shwarama is amazing.. With lebanese spices and veggies and sauce and they also serve it with a side of salad!"
301328,Stop making fool people. There's big difference between Kathi roll and veg shawarama . U just serving Kathi rolls. Not Arabic shawarama. Paneer was nice
305147,Visited here long time back with one of my friend.  Had Cappuccino and Chicken Sandwich.  Cappuccino was good in taste but like Chicken Sandwich was excellent.
305147,This place has decent interiors and good option in menu. Visited here long time back. Had coffee and Chicken Ham Sandwich which was good in taste but service was quite slow which has disappointed me.
305147,"Though they take time in food preparation but i think its worth waiting for. I was not having cash and their card payment machine was not working too, the staff was sweet to corporate."
305147,"Delicuous food üòã I ordered sandwich dimsim and tea, absolutely fantastic just loved the staff and food ambience is ok ok but for food 10/10 üòç üòò"
305147,"This place is descendent to the extremely popular Shoe Garage. Situated in the middle of one of the hippest neighborhoods of the city, this place is extremely popular. The regulars swear by their coffee and savoury snacks.  DECOR: It's done up nicely, with interesting wall frames, simple furniture and colours used in a rather creative way.  WHAT I HAD: I ordered an Americano. I'll surely give a thumbs up for the coffee. It was nicely prepared. To go with that, I ordered a vegetable grilled sandwich. It was above average and nothing extraordinary. The cheese omelette was prepared in a rather interesting way and was definitely my favorite from the lot. I also ordered Maggie but they served me Top ramen instead, which were topped with grilled veggies. They was delicious and so filling.  SERVICE: Although the staff was genuinely sweet and courteous, the service took some time. But I'm not complaining as everything was nicely prepared.  This place is perfect if you want to work in solitude, chill with your buddies or perhaps grab a quick meal. They also play good music.  Kudos to TCG."
9890,"I always rated their labanga lotika and chitrakoot as must haves. But last evening the chitrakoot I bought from them was completely spoilt, stale and bad smell. The labanga lotika was way too sweet even for a sweet toothed bengali. Very sad and dissappointing to see their standard deteriorate to this extent. To think of it I travelled all the way from Gurgaon to pick up these sweets only to discover that it was a wasted effort."
9890,"Tried various types of sandesh yesterday. If u have a sweet tooth, i'd say anything and everything here is wonderful. Do visit if u r looking for good Bengali sweets."
9890,"It's a small shop with very little ventilation, spreading its mishti doi's smell onto all other sweets and the whole closed space. Close your nose and buy rosogolla, everything else is stale."
9890,Awesome tasty Bengali sweets... Must visit place for sweets lover.. it is near gate no. 2 of green park metro station. One can also try Samosa's
9890,"Every dish served by them is so delicious that once you taste them you become the fan of their dishes. The moment you enter the place, the aroma of the place just doesn't let you stop yourself from buying something."
305684,Ordered customised cupcakes for a special occasion - not only did they look better than I expected but were also absolutely delicious. Super reasonable in terms of pricing as well! Can't wait to order again.
305684,It was very nice place. I love thise place .
305684,The ferrero rocher cake was simply yum ! It was packed so cutely and the quantity was also satisfactory. Definitely recommending this to my friends and hoping to order again !
305684,"Ordered cupcakes yesterday for a friend. Everyone loved it, best cupcakes I ever had üòç On-time delivery, excellent quality. In short, best service. 5 on 5 recommendation ‚ù§"
305684,The Ultimate Chocolate Brownie definitely melts-in-your-mouth! I have ordered this particular brownie time and again and it always has the if not the same better taste each time. I am in complete love with this brownie and without a doubt its the best one I have had in a very long time. Best for your sweet cravings!!!
306554,"Ordered a chicken burger and grilled chicken stake last week. The grilled chicken escalope was juicy and succulent with an amazing sauce, one of the best I have ever had. This is a must try dish here. They also have a huge variety of burgers and other dishes. Overall, a great experience from Captain Grub and will try some more for sure."
306554,I recieved incomplete order and I am not happy at all. Will not order again from Zomato or the restaurant captain grub. Very very Bad bad service.
306554,"So i have placed an order yesterday to captain grub. First the delivery boy forget to deliver a few mentioned items. I have order 2 burgers with them, and have asked to add fried onions in one and jalape√±o, cheese and pickles in the second. Guess what that didn‚Äôt add shit and charged me extra for the add-ons. Secondly lasagna is crap, neither it tasted good nor it had any vegetables. These guys either have no idea how to cook lasagna or they just want to fool the customers. These guys have food that taste horrendous. I have to add veggies from ref to make it look like a god damn burger. Food is way to expensive as compared with the quality."
306554,Hiii Captain grub I appreciate yo your team work I'm regular customer of captain grub I ordered last four years .but I show you are maintained the food quality your packaging also improve.now your packaging also really looking good. Excellent guy's keep it up.
310723,"You might have to struggle to find a place to sit. The service is super fast, favoured for quick bites. The burgers at Burger King are no doubt the best. They have cheap ad-ons, like 29 bucks for a cold drink."
310723,The food served is delicious and pocket friendly.. I like the offers too
310723,I went with my friends. I tried brownie sundae.. it was amazing taste.. I liked it
310723,"Had ordered king size french fries in my last order but half of the packet was empty, the ones which got delivered was not even the size of regular fries. Had shared the snap with zomato and they suggested to give feedback, as they were unable to connect burger king team."
2778,The food was very pathetic lamb was so lumpy chicken very hard noodles awful...worst food  ever ordered from Nanking....had to throw everything strongly condemned
2778,Another of my favourites for Chinese food . Can‚Äôt go wrong with most recipes. Other benefits- ample space and courteous staff
2778,It is the worst service and food You could ever eat! Will never go back to this place
2778,The food is great but the hygiene is not made. I would really appreciate if the management could look into the food hygiene level. The food is really delicious and they have the nicest kung pao chicken üçó. I like the chicken halka noodles as wel
310169,"Upto the mark & very affordable.  The food was good & nicely prepared, also served very fast. Try this place if you are a mughlai food lover"
310169,Its was my 1st time to been @tipu sultan restaurant  An it's very homely /Friendly restaurant With there authentic delicious food  I loved to have Mughlai foods hear I really enjoyed We ordered many things to have But I loved the most Is phirni it was to yummy  Thank From @Ghar.kaa.khana To serve as a amazing food
310169,Awesome food served with extreme delicacies...The owner Farhan is extremely caring and will make you feel homely with extra love and care added to each food item... Always love coming here..!!! In love with this place...Would highly recommend this place...would give 10/10 to this place...:)
310169,Amazing food. Quality and taste is unmatched. Everyone is selling mugali in their menu but this is authentic mugali North India food served with passion and perfection. Tried their special veg thali and every component of it was so delicious and freshly prepared. Also ordered garlic tikka which was too spicy but the onwer was kind enough to replace it with the badami tikka right away. That's what is called true customer centricity. All the best guys. Keep up the great service and this level of quality. No doubt the best North Indian (perfect mugali lucknawi) restaurant.
310169,"Absolutely horrible food. Disgrace in the name of nihari and mutton galouti. They changed their chefs and food has become pathetic. We spoke to the owner, he said the food is like this only. Absolute disgrace.  This is what they call a soft galouti by the way. Absolutely disgusted."
311345,Very delicious food  and very nice staff you can try the white Sauce pasta with chicken and the chicken pizza and different kinds of food like pizza and burgers and pasta also try the barbecue sauce chicken
311345,This was the second time myself and my family have visited this restaurant. Customer service was poor-staff need to soft their manner out. Doesn't cost anything for a polite smile or I'll be with you in a minute when they are busy.such a shame really but won't be back a third time...
311345,This place is awesome and the staff is really great and helpful. I highly recommend. The staff¬† was exceptionally helpful...Their tandoori chicken is amazing. Must try
311345,The kebabs here are delicious but expensive. I love the malai kebab here.. it melts in the mouth. The non-veg food is also really good. The staffs are really nice and friendly. Highly recommended.
311345,The food quality is very good...veery poltte staff ..the service is really nice... Everything is perfect....keep it up the great job.... . Must try..
312300,Mind blowing South Indian food ! From rasam to fish to chicken...everything was brilliant ! One of the best chicken chettinad I have had. The malabar paratha was crispy and tasty while the appam was rightly done. First place in delhi that I have come across who serves fresh sole fish and not the frozen one. The fish curry was really good. We enjoyed our meal here thoroughly.   Walk in : for a meal with your folks Must have : rasam and chicken chettinad  Cheers !
312300,"It's a lovely place, beautiful Interiors and courteous staff to enjoy coastal delicacies at their best. Kids loved their button idlis, neer dosa, Apam with stew. I personally loved their Kerala fish with rice and Egg Apam and Malabar Porontho with Chicken Chettinand. Loved it and will visit again for sure."
312300,Peninaular kitchen thanks for making my day what a fantastic food i have ever had. Great service.  I would definitely recommend their mutton vindaloo with malabar parantha so delicious.. I  am sure i will visit again.... Keep it up and thanx sunil for your service...... and ur recommendation really work.......
312300,Pathetic swrvice by the restuarant  and totally rude staff instead of apolozing for there mistake  They did nothing and just have so much of attitude problem
312300,"In the yesteryear's of Treta Yuga even the most puissant, ambitious, intentional and dynamically intelligent mind from the Dravidian society probably faced the issues to consummate maybe because of their southern dark colour with deep eyes and moustaches that he ended up kidnapping or took as hostage the person he liked in the name of ""revenge"" for his sister, The Ravan. But with Kal Yuga stepping in, the problems faced by the Southerners or Dravidians as to put themselves out there for acceptance by the fair coloured dominance in terms of culture, ethics, opinions, availability and sustainability has completely vanished. Contemporarily Bahubali is crossing crores that Bollywood could ever imagine and Prabhas(the lead) is the new ""White"" who is much more desired within the bairn.  Luckily for nippers like me the greatest achievement is the act of consenting of their cuisine.  With numerous upcoming waterholes on Peninsular or the island's cuisine, my ship made port at the Peninsular Kitchen, which reflects the greys, the greens and the yellows from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala , Karnataka and Goa.  Concocted with jute and wooden tables are the amber shimmering artefacts and a menu spanning over 100 dishes covering the specialties of each southern state with some familiars, its bar is definitely not left out from the former.  From Tamil Nadu's repertoire i ordered the renowned chettinad preparation of paneer or cottage cheese. Hot and pungent with freshly ground masala, it did have the fragrance of its own but lacked a mouthful taste and rush of that spiciness. One of the oldest surviving cuisines the Kannada, i called Aloo Gedde a mildly spiced yellow coconut curry with cubes of potatoes worked well with hot Appams.  Though unapologetically my favourite would be another from Tamil Nadu's delights the Chicken Ghee Roast. Succulent pieces of chicken on the bone lathered in a thick, spicy and hot tomato onion gravy cooked and served with a dollop of ghee(clarified butter) will surely give you an insight of gods bhog. And what brings out the richness is a piping hot and an airy egg appam.   Try eating what's trending not only in the food industry also for the yester greatest mind and your favourite Bahubali."
3072,The best to eat üòç from here
3072,Totally worth. The sizzler is totally delicious. The taste is unique and special. Love this place.
2436,It has one of the best coffees I have had.
2436,Excellent cup of coffee and cinnamon sticks. Must visit if you haven't tried the cinnamon roll and cinnamon stick.
4905,The service is very nice along with the price they ask!!.. the sangria is a must try for all ladies!! As well as the prawnsüòç!! The ambience is also well done
4905,"Kylin a brand name that never fails to disappoint. They are the industry standard in taste, quality and most importantly consistent. I‚Äôm a regular at this place- I usually order their veg dim sums. Thai curry with Jasmin rice. I‚Äôve almost tried all their veg dim sums & all the Thai curries.I‚Äôm never disappointed in this restaurant.   Love the place!"
4905,"The staff service and food was on point. Especially the bowl meals, do try! The variety of options were very pleasing. Not necessarily for non vegetarians, as the vegetarian menu is a surprise in itself."
4905,"A great rooftop setting for romantic dates with your loved ones.  Spacious roof with airy atmosphere.  Visited on a Sunday evening and it was completely packed. A reservation helped me to get the table, however it was not one of the best the place had to offer.  Later the staff helped in getting a better and comfortable table. At the start the service was slow but after a small discussion it was great.  Food and drinks were usual compared to any other place.  The sheesha was a big disappointment as it was not right. They tried to fix it but still it was not worth the price.   Personally would go there again to enjoy the food options only and that too at the indoor section."
4905,"Pleasant place. Good, polite servers. Signature peanuts with lemon grass flavor are palatable . #sheesha guy satisfied us with choice of flavor ...kiwi&mint ....really good...so far best #sheesha. Hospitality by B S Mehta is great. GRILLED Chicken too is to taste with a dash of wasabi, on request. To top it , DJ üëç"
1060,Awesome biryani... Loved it
1060,Everything was so good in taste that it was sufficient for 5 to 6 ppl and after that also food was left. Loved the taste and it came so fresh. This place is totally rocking..  So many cuisines at reasonable prices..  I was expecting some guests at home and was so confused what to order. I tried this place and order... . .
18180041,"Croquet Monsieur and The Morning After, literal hangover cures. Coffee Glazed Bacon, Goat Cheese and Rockets on Sourdough are a match made in Heaven. Meat lovers rejoice! One of the best sandwich combinations out there, definitely give it a try!"
18180041,I recently tried Big fat sandwich while i was in Ambiance mall for shopping. The options are available in both veg and non veg....So i chose their sloppy joe sandwich in multigrain bread which has filling of chicken in the form of keema along with their cheesy fries and orange juice.  The juice was fresh and thats the best part that they prepared it fresh so it was great....The sandwich was also nice and they served the orderd within few mintues.  The best solution to hunger pangs in a healthier manner.
18180041,"Big fat sandwich known for sandwiches as the name says, goes very well if you are in VK mall for shopping. Serving some healthy sandwiches with options to choose from veg or non veg....  I tried their Firecracker sandwich in multigrain bread along with onion rings and fresh orange juice.  Their onion rings were really good and also sandwich. Fresh juice is healthy so goes very well with this combo.  They also serve salads and hotdogs along with shakes."
18180041,Smashin!!! Pataka!!! These are not only names of the dishes on the BFS menu but also are apt praise for their food. The Smashing chic is to die for with that mouth watering lemon flavoured grilled chicken breast fill. Mushroom sauce in it just adds to the dish and takes it straight to heaven. Its a cracker.  Cottage cheese in pataka just melts in your mouth and is a good opt for paneer lovers. Zatar marinated chicken with hummus burger was also very unique and was aptly named too.... Yalla Habibi!!! Yes my love for your food will follow you BFS......a big thumbs up!!!
18180041,"I love this place.... chicken qulty is good,serving portions is good , open sitting is vgood (winters only) Burger/ sandwich taste authentic western.  Hotdogs not so much have less meat taste and more of thick bread.... french fries r crispy   so try this place"
18144479,When you feel hungry at home and feel to eat a lovely Chinese order from here. Their packaging and delivery is very good. Really amazed to see their quantity. Chicken fried rice and Thai curry was awesome.
18144479,So We got the food home delivered it was fast and well packed. We ordered chicken wontons and kung fao panda meal in a box...and yesss!! The sweet sesame chilly and chillygarlic dip provided were very new to my tastebuds I really loved the dips...the meal box was good too.. :) But I dint find it value for money as quantity was less as compared to price! :/
18144479,"I ordered a Meal for two recently.  First the order was delayed by over 25 minutes. Then the packing was really boring and a The Sauces had leaked.  The dimsums were nice, the soup kinda bland, the hot garlic was nice.  Not Satisfied."
18144479,"Happy Hakka has become a prominent name if you are looking for some good Chinese food delivery options. They serve some good Chinese food in some parts of Delhi, Gurgaon and Noida.  Recently ordered Cheesy Pizza Pockets, Veg Shanghai Gravy Manchurian , Chilli Garlic Veg Chowmein and Veg Tangled Ramen.  Just Love their Cheesy Pizza Pockets. This is recommended dish.  Chilli Garlic Chowmein went well with Shanghai Gravy Manchurian. Flavours were balanced.  Tangled Ramen noodles was something new which I hadn't tried. It was also good.  Delivery came on time and there was no spilling of Food.  Keep following for discovering more new food joints."
18144479,"The momos in here are quite authentic and every dish has a different taste. When ordering momos, always go for happy hakka. Make sure to add a beverage to it for sure!"
302152,These are really nice and so is the meaty sandwich ü•™. The best to go coffee is javachip. And it‚Äôs amazing with whipped cream üíì the egg wrap with chicken sausage is great
302152,Located in ambience mall vasant kunj ... One of the good place to visit with friends. .... Have a nice and polite stafff. ... The food that u have ordered was amaing .....
302152,The frappe here are good. I recently tried their new item which is Spanish tres leches!! It is not good and nowhere near the dessert tres Leche
18264997,I had a white sauce pasta from this place and got terrible food positioning! Had to travel internationally the next day and I got hospitalized in a foreign country. Cannot express my regret eating here.
18264997,Pathetic behaviour   Based on 1+1 offer which is available via zomato gold we have visited the place.  Pathetic behaviour with the customer and denying for the offer.   I request zomato to remove the offer as the owner is not interested.
18264997,"Cafe Connect is a small tiny yet gorgeous cafe located in Vasant Kunj. It is not located at an easily accessible place or a cafe lane but adjacent to automobile repair shops. The location isn't the best one but the cafe itself looks beautiful from inside as well as outside, so that compensates the location of the cafe. Coming to the interiors, these days almost all cafes are pretty, so what we liked the most is their seating arrangements, absolutely comfortable sofas, on both sides of the tables, the seating areas are divided with translucent glass panels. At first, we were a little not okay with the price to the quantity ratio. They handed us a cafe menu and a restaurant menu, which had multiple cuisine options, but the sizes and the number of pieces of the dishes disappointed us.   We anyways ordered a butter chicken pizza and a chicken malai tikka, and for dessert we ordered red velvet pastry, hoping that they had put cream cheese frosting instead of the normal whipping cream which literally destroys the entire concept of red velvet cake.   Firstly the red in the red velvet comes from beetroot and the cake originally is a chocolate cake, however, in most of the bakeries and cafes, they serve a vanilla cake which is coloured using red food colour. And traditionally the red velvet cake should have cream cheese frosting and not just any white cream on top. The cream here looked pale yellow and we had good hopes since the frosting coloured seemed to be that of cream cheese, and we also asked the waiter, to which he confirmed that it was cream cheese but when it arrived, the moment we dig in our spoon in the pastry we just knew that it was buttercream and not cream cheese frosting. The sponge in the pastry was dry and all in all, it wasn't the best pastry that we tried, also 150 for this pastry is just not worth it.   Coming to the butter chicken pizza, those who follow our blogs must already know that butter chicken pizza is our staple pizza variant of pizza wherever we go. So here too, we ordered butter chicken pizza and they served us an 8-inch pizza which was honestly quite disappointing for the price of the pizza however thankfully they loaded the pizza with a generous amount of butter chicken gravy, mozzarella and about 12 to 14 chunks of tikkas. And we absolutely loved the toppings and the quality of the base which was crunchy yet soft, just the right texture and the toppings were delicious, enlarging the experience of an 8-inch pizza to a 12-inch pizza.   Coming to the Murg malai tikka, if we didn't have access to zomato gold, it would have hurt our pockets hard to pay 279rs for 5 pieces of tikka, but again keeping aside the quantity, they made up for all that by inducing lovely flavours in the tikka. The taste of the tikkas was an absolute bliss.   Overall, they made up for their less quantity by serving quality food, prices are slightly on th3 higher side, red velvet pastry was disappointing, the presentations could have been much much better since the plates they used made the food look sort of roadside presentation with plastic colourful plates. It isn't the biggest concern but for bloggers and vloggers the presentation of food matters for an aesthetic click.   All in all, it was a good experience but the quantity to price ratio is not great.   We would rate it a ‚Öó starts."
18264997,"I placed an order at 8:20 pm, estd del time 9:45 pm & the food arrived at 11:00 pm. The food arrived cold even tho the restaurant is just 10 mins away. I understand holidays & rush hour but 2 hrs 40 mins is TOO TOO MUCH! Worst is they arrived at a time when we couldn't order again. My old grandmother had to be kept waiting because of their ineptness. And the best they can offer is 'we'll deliver again tomo'. They have no decency or basic courtesy of what to say to disgruntled customers after making them wait so much. DISGUSTING & INCAPABLE SERVICE & STAFF!! Hospitality mgmt is not what it used to be."
1509,Angels always been an excellent confectionery.  The chocolate boat to my surprise was a little biscotti filled with chocolate;something like dark fantasy but ofcourse with a much more rich feel and taste. The blueberry cheesecake cup wasn‚Äôt as great with a sorry excuse of a crackle base and cream filling. even tho‚Äô the other cheesecake From here have never disappointed. Would stick to the normal cheesecake next time!
1509,Had this delicious chocolate almond mousse cup. It's a small bakery shop with variety of desserts. However you won't get dining space inside as space is very less. It's among one of the best bakery shop in vasant kunj.  Taste rating- 4/5
1509,The cakes were really good! Very moist and fresh. Delivery was delayed though
7068,Owner is too much bad they are cheat with staff salary product are not fresh at all
7068,The guacamole and salsa toast is to die for and ofcourse the frappe ‚ù§Ô∏è
7068,"Fro-Yo is at Red Mango premium as it is made from all natural ingredients. It comes in various flavors ranging from Ferrero Rocher, Mango, Strawberry, Blueberry and Red Velvet Cheesecake.  You can also choose various toppings for your yogurt ranging from fruits, dried fruits, syrups and chocolates.  They charge you on per gram basis at 1.3rs/gram.  They also serve some snacks such as sandwiches and burgers, but I haven't tried those yet."
7068,"I have been regular to red mango since last couple of years. But the condition of the ambience Vasant Kunj outlet has been deteriorating. The food quality and hygiene are a big question mark. I have gotten sick a couple of times after eating there and have given the feedback to the staff working there too. But it doesn‚Äôt seem to be improving. You can get a sense of their cleanliness by looking at their kitchen. It‚Äôs becoming dirtier by the day. I resorted to writing this review because yesterday I had food there, and now am suffering from bad case of food poisoning."
311423,"Had a casual meet up with my office collegues. Ordered pasta alfredo, masala maggi and paneer pizza. Pasta was cheesy and included good bits of mushroom and Maggi was flavourful. I was disappointed with the panner pizza, the panner was little undercooked or not as fresh which actually ruined my pizza taste."
311423,"It was a team outing and we all loved everything of this beer joint, from ambience to vast selection of beers to food and Special mention to their staff particularly Christopher who took a real good care of us. He is very well versed with with the entire menu and suggested us the best."
311423,"Today I was visit at beer cafe vasant kunj, I really love the hopper beer in draught , service is very quick with friendly staff."
7228,"The guy serving me had no sense how to explain about drinks, he showed me a drink which was of Rs 725/- but then later he charged double money and he had no explanation then he said we added this and that drink into it. So i couldn't able to do anything. Just left that place and that drink. Rude place, i suggest if you go there make sure you confirm the prices . I just had daal roti and that rubbish drink and bill was 3000. So make sure you confirm every price before eat."
7228,The food was not up to the mark. I ordered a thali and the rice was not cooked well. The other non veg food was average in terms of taste and below expectations.
7228,"Order type: Delivery  Quality: **** Taste: ** Packing: *** Prices as per food : *  Punjabi by nature is a big brand and food is usually good though the prices are always on a higher side.  I ordered a express meal considering their quality and good taste though the prices was quite higher in that respect. But when I received the food it was not up to the mark, naan was quite elastic as rubber and other food also was very very average. If I ordered that food from a normal restaurant then I could give 3 stars but from this restaurant and at this amount they don't deserve more than 2 stars.  I think they should continue with their dine in facility only bcoz with this express service they are not justifying with their customers. üëéüëé"
7228,Loved the place and food. Table was nicely decorated to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Asha did a very good job and especially complimentary cake was just yum!!
7228,Tried their gigantic chhole Bhature recently which were just too good. They were served at quite a decent place so I definitely loved the food over there. Found the virgin mojito quite overpriced though.
308697,Service need to improve
308697,"Food tastes great, is affordable and the staff is extremely polite. Has been my go to place for a long time now."
308697,"Great service, delicious Thalis!"
308697,Their bedmi puri halwa is too yum! Always pick up my mithai from here too. My kids love the laddoo and kaju barfi the most.
